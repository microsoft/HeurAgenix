in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP.

Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\n\nlocal_optimization: these heuristics focus on local optimizations such as swaps and shifts to improve the solution iteratively.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Each phase will leverage different heuristic categories to achieve optimal scheduling. Here's a suggested framework:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Begin by establishing an initial solution using a straightforward priority-based heuristic. This provides a baseline and a starting point for further optimization.\n   - Example Heuristics: `first_come_first_served_af26`, `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`\n\n2. **Priority and Work Remaining Assessment:**\n   - Evaluate jobs based on priority-based heuristics to identify which operations should be scheduled first.\n   - Simultaneously consider work-remaining-based heuristics to gauge the workload remaining for each job.\n   - Example Heuristics: `most_work_remaining_df20`, `least_work_remaining_66c9`\n\n3. **Dynamic and Adaptive Selection:**\n   - Apply dynamic and adaptive heuristics to refine the initial schedule based on real-time data and machine availability.\n   - Adjust the selection strategy by incorporating dynamic scoring to adapt to the problem's characteristics.\n   - Example Heuristics: `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`, `first_come_first_served_af26`\n\n4. **Randomized Diversification:**\n   - Introduce a randomized heuristic to diversify the solution space, preventing premature convergence on suboptimal solutions.\n   - Use sparingly to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n   - Example Heuristic: `random_6512`\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Local Optimization:**\n   - Focus on local optimization heuristics to iteratively improve the solution by making small adjustments.\n   - These adjustments should aim to reduce the makespan and improve machine utilization.\n   - Example Heuristics: `_3opt_6ee0`, `_2opt_f9c1`, `shift_operator_109f`\n\n2. **Adaptive Refinement:**\n   - Use dynamic and adaptive heuristics again to fine-tune the schedule as more data about the current solution becomes available.\n   - Example Heuristics: `most_work_remaining_df20`, `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`\n\n3. **Iterative Testing and Evaluation:**\n   - Continuously test different heuristic combinations, observing their impact on the solution quality.\n   - Adjust heuristic selection based on performance metrics like makespan, machine utilization, and job completion time.\n\n4. **Randomized Exploration:**\n   - Occasionally apply randomized heuristics to explore new areas of the solution space, especially if local optima are suspected.\n   - Example Heuristic: `random_6512`\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n- **Alternation Between Heuristics:** Regularly switch between heuristic categories to avoid stagnation and capture diverse scheduling strategies.\n- **Performance Monitoring:** Use performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of each heuristic and make data-driven decisions on when to switch heuristics.\n- **Iterative Approach:** Adopt an iterative approach where each phase informs the next, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation.\n\nThis strategic guide aims to create a flexible and adaptive framework for solving JSSP, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories throughout the problem-solving process."
