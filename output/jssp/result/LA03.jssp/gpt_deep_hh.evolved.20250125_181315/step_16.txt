I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id

        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.

    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively addressed using heuristic methods. Your framework, which includes the Solution and Operator classes, aligns well with the standard approach to tackle such problems. The use of operators to modify solutions is a common strategy in heuristic algorithms to explore the solution space. Additionally, the heuristic function signature you've proposed is comprehensive and allows for flexibility in implementing different heuristic strategies.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,work_remaining_based,local_optimization,dynamic_and_adaptive,randomized

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria like arrival time, processing time, or the longest processing time first.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

work_remaining_based: these heuristics focus on the remaining work or processing time of jobs to make scheduling decisions.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.

local_optimization: these heuristics focus on local optimizations such as swaps and shifts to improve the solution iteratively.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

dynamic_and_adaptive: these heuristics include dynamic scoring mechanisms or adapt based on specific dataset characteristics or iteration counts.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

randomized: this heuristic uses a random approach, which is generally less powerful but can be useful for diversification or as a baseline.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 0, 1, 3, 2], [4, 0, 1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3]]
job_operation_time:[[23, 45, 82, 84, 38], [21, 29, 18, 41, 50], [38, 54, 16, 52, 52], [37, 54, 74, 62, 57], [57, 81, 61, 68, 30], [81, 79, 89, 89, 11], [33, 20, 91, 20, 66], [24, 84, 32, 55, 8], [56, 7, 54, 64, 39], [40, 83, 19, 8, 7]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:47.66
max_operation_time:91
min_operation_time:7
std_deviation_operation_time:25.156001272062298
job_operation_time_range:84
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we can break down the process into two main phases: the Construction Phase and the Improvement Phase. Each phase will leverage different heuristic categories to achieve optimal scheduling. Here's a suggested framework:

### Construction Phase

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Begin by establishing an initial solution using a straightforward priority-based heuristic. This provides a baseline and a starting point for further optimization.
   - Example Heuristics: `first_come_first_served_af26`, `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`

2. **Priority and Work Remaining Assessment:**
   - Evaluate jobs based on priority-based heuristics to identify which operations should be scheduled first.
   - Simultaneously consider work-remaining-based heuristics to gauge the workload remaining for each job.
   - Example Heuristics: `most_work_remaining_df20`, `least_work_remaining_66c9`

3. **Dynamic and Adaptive Selection:**
   - Apply dynamic and adaptive heuristics to refine the initial schedule based on real-time data and machine availability.
   - Adjust the selection strategy by incorporating dynamic scoring to adapt to the problem's characteristics.
   - Example Heuristics: `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`, `first_come_first_served_af26`

4. **Randomized Diversification:**
   - Introduce a randomized heuristic to diversify the solution space, preventing premature convergence on suboptimal solutions.
   - Use sparingly to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.
   - Example Heuristic: `random_6512`

### Improvement Phase

1. **Local Optimization:**
   - Focus on local optimization heuristics to iteratively improve the solution by making small adjustments.
   - These adjustments should aim to reduce the makespan and improve machine utilization.
   - Example Heuristics: `_3opt_6ee0`, `_2opt_f9c1`, `shift_operator_109f`

2. **Adaptive Refinement:**
   - Use dynamic and adaptive heuristics again to fine-tune the schedule as more data about the current solution becomes available.
   - Example Heuristics: `most_work_remaining_df20`, `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`

3. **Iterative Testing and Evaluation:**
   - Continuously test different heuristic combinations, observing their impact on the solution quality.
   - Adjust heuristic selection based on performance metrics like makespan, machine utilization, and job completion time.

4. **Randomized Exploration:**
   - Occasionally apply randomized heuristics to explore new areas of the solution space, especially if local optima are suspected.
   - Example Heuristic: `random_6512`

### Strategic Considerations

- **Alternation Between Heuristics:** Regularly switch between heuristic categories to avoid stagnation and capture diverse scheduling strategies.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Use performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of each heuristic and make data-driven decisions on when to switch heuristics.
- **Iterative Approach:** Adopt an iterative approach where each phase informs the next, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation.

This strategic guide aims to create a flexible and adaptive framework for solving JSSP, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories throughout the problem-solving process.

Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Starting with a priority-based heuristic is advisable, given that all jobs remain unfinished and no operations have been scheduled yet. This approach will help establish an initial sequence for job scheduling, providing a structured starting point. Once a baseline is established, further refinement and optimization can be explored using other heuristic categories.

This category provides flexibility and adaptability, allowing the heuristic to respond to real-time data and current solution characteristics. By considering dynamic scoring mechanisms and adapting to the unique traits of the problem, we can explore different scheduling strategies that may lead to better machine utilization, reduced makespan, and advancement of job completion. This approach can help break the current stagnation and potentially offer new insights into improving the solution.

The last heuristic category is: most_work_remaining_df20(dynamic_and_adaptive). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,work_remaining_based,local_optimization,dynamic_and_adaptive,randomized

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:local_optimization
explanation: Given the current state where the makespan remains high and no jobs have been completed, despite attempts with dynamic and adaptive heuristics, it would be beneficial to switch to local optimization. Local optimization can help refine the existing solution by making targeted adjustments, such as swaps and shifts, to improve the scheduling order and potentially reduce the makespan. Since prior attempts with dynamic and adaptive heuristics have not significantly advanced job completion, focusing on local optimization might offer a more precise approach to enhancing the current solution. This category has the potential to identify and resolve inefficiencies within the current schedule, leading to improved job progress and reduced idle times.
