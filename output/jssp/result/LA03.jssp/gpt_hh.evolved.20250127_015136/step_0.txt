I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. Your framework, comprising the `Solution` and `Operator` classes and the standardized heuristic function signature, appears to be correctly structured for tackling the JSSP. The operators you have defined (e.g., `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, `ShiftOperator`) are typical examples of mechanisms used to explore the solution space in combinatorial optimization problems like JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable requires understanding the characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem at hand, as different heuristics are suited to different types of problems. Here is a brief overview of when each heuristic might be most applicable:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) - `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`**:  
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in minimizing the average completion time of jobs. It is particularly useful when jobs have similar priorities, and the focus is on throughput.
   - **Quantification**: Best suited when the variance in processing times across jobs is low, and minimizing wait times is critical.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - `first_come_first_served_af26`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where fairness is important, and jobs need to be processed in the order they arrive.
   - **Quantification**: Useful when job arrival times are staggered or when prioritization based on arrival is necessary.

3. **Most Work Remaining (MWR) - `most_work_remaining_df20`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where it is crucial to prioritize jobs that would otherwise delay the makespan significantly if deferred.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there is a wide disparity in job sizes and the goal is to manage larger jobs early.

4. **Shift Operator - `shift_operator_109f`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful for fine-tuning a schedule by making small adjustments to reduce makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when the initial solution is close to optimal, and small refinements can yield significant improvements.

5. **3-opt Heuristic - `_3opt_6ee0`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for exploring local optimizations in well-constrained problems where large-scale reordering is impractical.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the search space is large, and local optima need to be bypassed.

6. **Longest Job Next (LJN) - `longest_job_next_2e23`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes longer jobs to potentially reduce their impact on the overall schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Useful when there are a few jobs with significantly longer processing times compared to others.

7. **2-opt Heuristic - `_2opt_f9c1`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Effective for making simple swaps to improve schedule efficiency, often used after an initial solution is found.
   - **Quantification**: Works well when the solution space is not too large, allowing for comprehensive exploration of swaps.

8. **Random Selection - `random_6512`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful for introducing diversity into the solution space exploration.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in early stages of heuristic exploration or when solutions are stuck in local optima.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) - `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**:  
   - **Scenario**: Effective for balancing load across machines by scheduling longer tasks earlier.
   - **Quantification**: Best in balanced environments where distributing workload evenly is a priority.

10. **Least Work Remaining (LWR) - `least_work_remaining_66c9`**:  
    - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the least amount of work left, potentially clearing them from the schedule sooner.
    - **Quantification**: Useful when reducing the number of active jobs quickly is more beneficial than focusing on processing time.

11. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) - `shortest_job_next_5b42`**:  
    - **Scenario**: Minimizes the number of waiting jobs by quickly completing those with shorter processing times.
    - **Quantification**: Applicable in environments where job completion rate is more critical than total processing time.

These heuristics can be selected based on the specific characteristics and constraints of the job shop scheduling problem being addressed.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N

Based on the provided global and state data, we can determine the initial approach for tackling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem using the heuristics available. Given the characteristics of the problem and the current state where no operations have been scheduled yet, we should focus on starting the scheduling process efficiently.

Considering the high variance in operation times (as indicated by the standard deviation) and the fact that no jobs have been completed, a good starting heuristic would be one that prioritizes operations based on their processing times. This can help establish an initial schedule that balances machine load and minimizes idle times.

Therefore, I suggest starting with the **Shortest Processing Time First** heuristic, as it is designed to handle such scenarios by minimizing the processing time of operations queued for scheduling.

Here is the response based on the decision:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
running steps: 5
explanation: Starting with the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic will help establish an initial schedule that minimizes machine idle times and balances the workload efficiently, given the high variance in operation times.
