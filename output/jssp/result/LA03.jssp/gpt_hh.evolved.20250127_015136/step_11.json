in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Here is a brief overview of when each heuristic might be most applicable:\n\n1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) - `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in minimizing the average completion time of jobs. It is particularly useful when jobs have similar priorities, and the focus is on throughput.\n   - **Quantification**: Best suited when the variance in processing times across jobs is low, and minimizing wait times is critical.\n\n2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - `first_come_first_served_af26`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where fairness is important, and jobs need to be processed in the order they arrive.\n   - **Quantification**: Useful when job arrival times are staggered or when prioritization based on arrival is necessary.\n\n3. **Most Work Remaining (MWR) - `most_work_remaining_df20`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where it is crucial to prioritize jobs that would otherwise delay the makespan significantly if deferred.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there is a wide disparity in job sizes and the goal is to manage larger jobs early.\n\n4. **Shift Operator - `shift_operator_109f`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Useful for fine-tuning a schedule by making small adjustments to reduce makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the initial solution is close to optimal, and small refinements can yield significant improvements.\n\n5. **3-opt Heuristic - `_3opt_6ee0`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for exploring local optimizations in well-constrained problems where large-scale reordering is impractical.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the search space is large, and local optima need to be bypassed.\n\n6. **Longest Job Next (LJN) - `longest_job_next_2e23`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes longer jobs to potentially reduce their impact on the overall schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Useful when there are a few jobs with significantly longer processing times compared to others.\n\n7. **2-opt Heuristic - `_2opt_f9c1`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Effective for making simple swaps to improve schedule efficiency, often used after an initial solution is found.\n   - **Quantification**: Works well when the solution space is not too large, allowing for comprehensive exploration of swaps.\n\n8. **Random Selection - `random_6512`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Useful for introducing diversity into the solution space exploration.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable in early stages of heuristic exploration or when solutions are stuck in local optima.\n\n9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) - `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Effective for balancing load across machines by scheduling longer tasks earlier.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in balanced environments where distributing workload evenly is a priority.\n\n10. **Least Work Remaining (LWR) - `least_work_remaining_66c9`**:  \n    - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the least amount of work left, potentially clearing them from the schedule sooner.\n    - **Quantification**: Useful when reducing the number of active jobs quickly is more beneficial than focusing on processing time.\n\n11. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) - `shortest_job_next_5b42`**:  \n    - **Scenario**: Minimizes the number of waiting jobs by quickly completing those with shorter processing times.\n    - **Quantification**: Applicable in environments where job completion rate is more critical than total processing time.\n\nThese heuristics can be selected based on the specific characteristics and constraints of the job shop scheduling problem being addressed."

The high variance in operation times suggests that further application of this heuristic could help optimize the schedule by minimizing the makespan and increasing machine utilization.

How does shortest_processing_time_first_d471 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
