                "text": "Analyzing the applicability and scenarios for each heuristic can help in understanding when they might perform best. Here's a breakdown of scenarios where each heuristic might be most effective:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when slight adjustments in the sequence of operations could lead to significant improvements in makespan. It is especially useful in tightly scheduled environments where minor changes can yield better performance.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied in moderately congested environments where small shifts can alleviate bottlenecks.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where minimizing individual task durations can lead to better overall scheduling efficiency. Particularly useful when tasks have varying processing times and shorter tasks can be quickly completed to free up resources.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for systems with high variability in operation times and when quickly clearing short tasks leads to reduced waiting times.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when local improvements through 2-opt swaps can approximate the benefits of a 3-opt move, which is typically more computationally intensive. Best in complex scheduling scenarios where several local swaps might cumulatively lead to a more efficient schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in complex systems with many interdependencies where iterative local swaps can cumulatively optimize the schedule.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizing longer jobs can be beneficial in environments where completing large jobs early reduces the overall system load and balances resource utilization.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with significant variance in job lengths, where early completion of longer jobs smooths resource allocation over time.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Scenario**: Works well in schedules where non-adjacent swaps can lead to significant reductions in makespan. Applicable in situations where the initial schedule is far from optimal, and major improvements are needed.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for highly suboptimal initial schedules where large changes can lead to significant improvements.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or in environments where randomness can help escape local optima. It can be effective in highly dynamic systems where deterministic strategies might not capture all nuances.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in highly dynamic or unpredictable environments where exploration is necessary.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the most remaining work, which can be effective in balancing the load and ensuring that large jobs do not delay completion excessively.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in load-balancing scenarios where large jobs risk bottlenecking the system.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic can be effective when longer tasks are likely to become bottlenecks. Scheduling these tasks first can help in managing resource allocation more effectively.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for environments where longer tasks are critical and can significantly impact overall scheduling.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for quickly clearing small tasks, which can reduce the complexity of the remaining schedule and free up resources.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied in scenarios with many small tasks that can be completed quickly, thereby simplifying the scheduling of remaining tasks.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in environments where completing shorter jobs first can reduce the waiting time for subsequent jobs, improving the flow of operations.\n    - **Quantification**: Effective in systems with a mix of job lengths where quickly completing shorter jobs can improve throughput.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Scenario**: Best in environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over efficiency. Useful as a baseline or when jobs have similar processing times.\n    - **Quantification**: Suitable for environments where job arrival order is significant or when simplicity is required.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary based on the specific characteristics of the JSSP instance being solved."

This approach aims to identify and exploit any local improvements that could lead to a reduced makespan or better overall schedule efficiency.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 18---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: The shift_operator_109f heuristic previously demonstrated a significant reduction in makespan by fine-tuning the sequence of operations. It could potentially offer further improvements by minimizing idle times and better optimizing the sequence within machine queues, which might help overcome the current plateau in optimization.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 19---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain: Attempting a few more steps with \"shift_operator_109f\" to explore if there are any remaining small optimizations that could be capitalized upon. The previous success indicates potential, but if no improvement is observed, a change in strategy will be necessary.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 20---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: The `_3opt_6ee0` heuristic can potentially break the current optimization plateau by exploring more complex swaps than 2-opt. This approach might introduce new changes that reduce idle times or improve the sequence within machine queues, potentially leading to a reduced makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 21---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The `_3opt_6ee0` heuristic can potentially explore more complex rearrangements in the schedule, which might help break the current plateau in optimization. Given that simpler heuristics have not yielded recent improvements, running `_3opt_6ee0` for a few more steps could identify beneficial changes that reduce the makespan or improve schedule efficiency. Increasing the steps to 5 allows for a more thorough exploration of potential swaps.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: _3opt_6ee0. How does _3opt_6ee0 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
