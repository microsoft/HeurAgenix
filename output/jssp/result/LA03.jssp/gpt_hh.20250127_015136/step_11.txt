I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id

        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.

    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding an optimal order or sequence of operations across machines to minimize objectives such as makespan, total completion time, or lateness. Your framework, utilizing solutions, operators, and heuristic algorithms, fits well within the realm of solving such problems. The Solution and Operator classes you've outlined, along with the heuristic function signature, are appropriate for addressing the complexities of JSSP using hyper-heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability and scenarios for each heuristic can help in understanding when they might perform best. Here's a breakdown of scenarios where each heuristic might be most effective:

1. **shift_operator_109f**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when slight adjustments in the sequence of operations could lead to significant improvements in makespan. It is especially useful in tightly scheduled environments where minor changes can yield better performance.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied in moderately congested environments where small shifts can alleviate bottlenecks.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where minimizing individual task durations can lead to better overall scheduling efficiency. Particularly useful when tasks have varying processing times and shorter tasks can be quickly completed to free up resources.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for systems with high variability in operation times and when quickly clearing short tasks leads to reduced waiting times.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when local improvements through 2-opt swaps can approximate the benefits of a 3-opt move, which is typically more computationally intensive. Best in complex scheduling scenarios where several local swaps might cumulatively lead to a more efficient schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in complex systems with many interdependencies where iterative local swaps can cumulatively optimize the schedule.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizing longer jobs can be beneficial in environments where completing large jobs early reduces the overall system load and balances resource utilization.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with significant variance in job lengths, where early completion of longer jobs smooths resource allocation over time.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Works well in schedules where non-adjacent swaps can lead to significant reductions in makespan. Applicable in situations where the initial schedule is far from optimal, and major improvements are needed.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for highly suboptimal initial schedules where large changes can lead to significant improvements.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or in environments where randomness can help escape local optima. It can be effective in highly dynamic systems where deterministic strategies might not capture all nuances.
   - **Quantification**: Best in highly dynamic or unpredictable environments where exploration is necessary.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the most remaining work, which can be effective in balancing the load and ensuring that large jobs do not delay completion excessively.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in load-balancing scenarios where large jobs risk bottlenecking the system.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic can be effective when longer tasks are likely to become bottlenecks. Scheduling these tasks first can help in managing resource allocation more effectively.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for environments where longer tasks are critical and can significantly impact overall scheduling.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for quickly clearing small tasks, which can reduce the complexity of the remaining schedule and free up resources.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied in scenarios with many small tasks that can be completed quickly, thereby simplifying the scheduling of remaining tasks.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in environments where completing shorter jobs first can reduce the waiting time for subsequent jobs, improving the flow of operations.
    - **Quantification**: Effective in systems with a mix of job lengths where quickly completing shorter jobs can improve throughput.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Scenario**: Best in environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over efficiency. Useful as a baseline or when jobs have similar processing times.
    - **Quantification**: Suitable for environments where job arrival order is significant or when simplicity is required.

Each heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary based on the specific characteristics of the JSSP instance being solved.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the provided data and previous rounds, let's analyze the situation. The heuristic `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` has been consistently effective in advancing operations and reducing the makespan. The shift in Round 7 with `shift_operator_109f` provided a significant reduction in makespan, indicating that fine-tuning through shifting can be beneficial, but the subsequent return to `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` continued to yield improvements.

Given that there is only one unfinished job and the consistent performance of `shortest_processing_time_first_c374`, it may be beneficial to continue with this heuristic to complete the remaining job and potentially finalize the schedule. However, given the diminishing returns observed in recent rounds, it might be prudent to run for a few steps to avoid unnecessary computation if improvement stalls.

Hereâs the recommended course of action:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
running steps: 3
explanation: Continue with `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` to advance the remaining unfinished job. Running for 3 steps allows us to gauge if further improvements are possible without committing to excessive computation.
