in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

The scenarios are based on common characteristics of job scheduling environments, such as job length, variability, and resource availability:\n\n1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** High variability in processing times among jobs. This heuristic is best when there are significant differences in operation times, and the goal is to minimize idle times on machines by prioritizing shorter tasks.\n   - **Quantification:** Best used when the coefficient of variation in job processing times is high.\n\n2. **first_come_first_served_af26():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Suitable for environments where jobs arrive dynamically over time, and fairness or order of arrival is a priority.\n   - **Quantification:** Best when job arrival times are staggered or unpredictable, and average waiting time needs to be minimized.\n\n3. **most_work_remaining_df20():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Effective in scenarios where it's crucial to ensure that longer, more complex jobs are completed on time, potentially reducing risk of bottlenecks later.\n   - **Quantification:** Useful when there is a high variance in job lengths, and the longest jobs are more critical to overall throughput.\n\n4. **shift_operator_109f():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Environments where local optimizations can lead to significant improvements in makespan. Useful when minor adjustments can significantly impact efficiency.\n   - **Quantification:** Best in systems where small scheduling adjustments yield large efficiency gains, often with a high machine usage variance.\n\n5. **_3opt_6ee0():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Complex scheduling environments where intricate adjustments are needed to achieve optimal performance.\n   - **Quantification:** Effective in high-complexity scenarios with many interdependencies between job sequences.\n\n6. **longest_job_next_2e23():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Similar to \"most work remaining,\" it\u2019s optimal for addressing bottlenecks early by prioritizing jobs with the longest total processing time remaining.\n   - **Quantification:** Most effective when the distribution of job processing times is skewed towards longer jobs.\n\n7. **_2opt_f9c1():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Suitable for refining a near-optimal solution by making small, strategic adjustments to job sequences.\n   - **Quantification:** Best when the initial solution is close to optimal, and only minor adjustments are needed.\n\n8. **random_6512():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Useful in exploratory phases of scheduling to avoid local optima by introducing randomness.\n   - **Quantification:** Effective in low-stakes scenarios where exploration is needed, or when other heuristics are stuck in local optima.\n\n9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9():**\n   - **Applicable Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs that are most resource-intensive, which can be beneficial in environments with high resource contention.\n   - **Quantification:** Best when machine usage is highly competitive, and longer jobs need prioritization.\n\n10. **least_work_remaining_66c9():**\n    - **Applicable Scenario:** Effective for environments where quick turnover is prioritized, and minimizing the number of active jobs is beneficial.\n    - **Quantification:** Best when the focus is on minimizing the number of incomplete jobs at any time.\n\n11. **shortest_job_next_5b42():**\n    - **Applicable Scenario:** Useful for environments where completing as many jobs as possible in a short time frame is desired.\n    - **Quantification:** Best in settings where job completion rate is a higher priority than overall makespan.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited to different operational environments.

How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
