I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence for executing a set of jobs on a set of machines, which is a classic example of combinatorial optimization. Heuristics are commonly used to solve such problems because they can efficiently explore the solution space and provide near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame. Your framework with the Solution and Operator classes seems well-suited to implement various heuristic algorithms to tackle JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Here's an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The scenarios are based on common characteristics of job scheduling environments, such as job length, variability, and resource availability:

1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** High variability in processing times among jobs. This heuristic is best when there are significant differences in operation times, and the goal is to minimize idle times on machines by prioritizing shorter tasks.
   - **Quantification:** Best used when the coefficient of variation in job processing times is high.

2. **first_come_first_served_af26():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Suitable for environments where jobs arrive dynamically over time, and fairness or order of arrival is a priority.
   - **Quantification:** Best when job arrival times are staggered or unpredictable, and average waiting time needs to be minimized.

3. **most_work_remaining_df20():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Effective in scenarios where it's crucial to ensure that longer, more complex jobs are completed on time, potentially reducing risk of bottlenecks later.
   - **Quantification:** Useful when there is a high variance in job lengths, and the longest jobs are more critical to overall throughput.

4. **shift_operator_109f():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Environments where local optimizations can lead to significant improvements in makespan. Useful when minor adjustments can significantly impact efficiency.
   - **Quantification:** Best in systems where small scheduling adjustments yield large efficiency gains, often with a high machine usage variance.

5. **_3opt_6ee0():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Complex scheduling environments where intricate adjustments are needed to achieve optimal performance.
   - **Quantification:** Effective in high-complexity scenarios with many interdependencies between job sequences.

6. **longest_job_next_2e23():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Similar to "most work remaining," it’s optimal for addressing bottlenecks early by prioritizing jobs with the longest total processing time remaining.
   - **Quantification:** Most effective when the distribution of job processing times is skewed towards longer jobs.

7. **_2opt_f9c1():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Suitable for refining a near-optimal solution by making small, strategic adjustments to job sequences.
   - **Quantification:** Best when the initial solution is close to optimal, and only minor adjustments are needed.

8. **random_6512():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Useful in exploratory phases of scheduling to avoid local optima by introducing randomness.
   - **Quantification:** Effective in low-stakes scenarios where exploration is needed, or when other heuristics are stuck in local optima.

9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9():**
   - **Applicable Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs that are most resource-intensive, which can be beneficial in environments with high resource contention.
   - **Quantification:** Best when machine usage is highly competitive, and longer jobs need prioritization.

10. **least_work_remaining_66c9():**
    - **Applicable Scenario:** Effective for environments where quick turnover is prioritized, and minimizing the number of active jobs is beneficial.
    - **Quantification:** Best when the focus is on minimizing the number of incomplete jobs at any time.

11. **shortest_job_next_5b42():**
    - **Applicable Scenario:** Useful for environments where completing as many jobs as possible in a short time frame is desired.
    - **Quantification:** Best in settings where job completion rate is a higher priority than overall makespan.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited to different operational environments. The key is to align the heuristic's characteristics with the specific requirements and constraints of the scheduling scenario.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_d471. How does shortest_processing_time_first_d471 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the information provided, let's analyze the current situation and decide on the next steps:

- **Heuristic Performance:** The "shortest_processing_time_first_d471" heuristic is currently being used and has resulted in a decrease in makespan, indicating improvement. However, the gains seem to be diminishing, as seen by the smaller decrease in makespan compared to previous rounds.
- **Current State:** There is still a significant proportion of unfinished jobs (0.75), suggesting that further optimization is needed to reduce the makespan and complete more jobs.
- **Variability and Complexity:** The job operation time has high variability, and there are many unfinished jobs. This situation suggests that further adjustments could be beneficial.

Given the high variability in operation times and the need to further optimize the schedule to complete more jobs, a heuristic that can handle high variability and continue to minimize idle times may be effective. Returning to a heuristic that can address these aspects might be beneficial.

**Decision:**

Continue with "shortest_processing_time_first_d471" for its effectiveness in minimizing idle times and efficiently utilizing machine resources. Given the diminishing returns, a moderate number of steps will allow us to evaluate its continued effectiveness.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
running steps: 5
explanation: Continuing with "shortest_processing_time_first_d471" to further reduce idle times and complete jobs more efficiently. A moderate number of steps are selected to evaluate the potential for continued improvement.
