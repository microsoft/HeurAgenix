I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence for a set of jobs, each consisting of a series of operations, to be processed on a set of machines, subject to various constraints. The problem is inherently combinatorial because it requires searching through a large space of potential solutions to find the best one that minimizes some objective, such as the makespan.

Your approach using a Solution and Operator framework fits well within the realm of heuristic methods for solving combinatorial problems like JSSP. Heuristics are often employed in these scenarios because they can provide good solutions within a reasonable time, even though they may not always guarantee the absolute best solution. The use of operators to modify solutions is a common strategy in heuristic optimization, allowing for exploration of the solution space in a structured manner.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,random_search

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time, remaining work, or job length to optimize scheduling.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

local_optimization: these heuristics use local search techniques to explore neighborhood solutions and improve the current schedule by making small modifications like swaps or shifts.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.

random_search: this heuristic uses randomness to explore the solution space, but it is generally less powerful compared to other more structured heuristics.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:20
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [3, 4, 1, 0, 2], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [1, 3, 4, 2, 0], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4], [1, 2, 3, 0, 4], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [3, 4, 2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 1, 4, 3], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [0, 2, 3, 4, 1], [1, 3, 4, 2, 0], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 3, 1], [1, 3, 4, 0, 2], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[23, 82, 84, 45, 38], [50, 41, 29, 18, 21], [16, 54, 52, 38, 52], [62, 57, 37, 74, 54], [68, 61, 30, 81, 57], [89, 89, 11, 79, 81], [66, 91, 33, 20, 20], [8, 24, 55, 32, 84], [7, 64, 39, 56, 54], [19, 40, 7, 8, 83], [63, 64, 91, 40, 6], [42, 61, 15, 98, 74], [80, 26, 75, 6, 87], [39, 22, 75, 24, 44], [15, 79, 8, 12, 20], [26, 43, 80, 22, 61], [62, 36, 63, 96, 40], [33, 18, 22, 5, 10], [64, 64, 89, 96, 95], [18, 23, 15, 38, 8]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each category and their potential impact on the solution process. Here's a framework to guide your selection and execution strategy:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Initial Construction Phase
- **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible initial solution.
- **Suggested Categories:** 
  - **Priority-Based Heuristics:** These heuristics are well-suited for the initial construction phase as they can rapidly establish a baseline solution by prioritizing jobs based on specific criteria.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Begin with a simple priority-based heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` to quickly create an initial schedule.
      2. Use `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `least_work_remaining_66c9` to refine the schedule by focusing on minimizing immediate processing times or remaining workloads.
      3. Evaluate the initial solution's makespan and identify areas for improvement.

#### Improvement Phase
- **Objective:** Refine and optimize the initial solution to minimize the makespan or other objective functions.
- **Suggested Categories:**
  - **Local Optimization Heuristics:** These are effective during the improvement phase as they explore the neighborhood of the current solution to make incremental improvements.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Apply `shift_operator_109f` to explore minor adjustments within machine queues.
      2. Use `_2opt_f9c1` and `_3opt_6ee0` to perform swaps that may uncover better sequences.
      3. Continuously monitor the impact of local changes on the makespan and iterate over the best-performing strategies.
  - **Random Search:** Incorporate randomness to escape local optima and explore diverse solutions.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Periodically introduce `random_6512` to add variability and prevent premature convergence.
      2. Use random search sparingly to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.

#### Iterative Process
- **Objective:** Continuously improve upon the solution by alternating between different heuristics and strategies.
- **Execution Steps:**
  1. Start with a priority-based heuristic to establish a baseline.
  2. Transition to local optimization heuristics to refine the solution.
  3. Introduce random search sporadically to ensure diversity in the solution space.
  4. Monitor performance metrics, such as makespan and machine utilization, to assess progress.
  5. Adjust the weightage and frequency of each heuristic category based on their performance in previous iterations.
  6. Document the effectiveness of each heuristic and use this data to inform future decisions.

### Final Considerations
- **Adaptability:** Be prepared to switch between heuristic categories based on real-time performance data.
- **Evaluation:** After each phase, evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen heuristics. If progress stalls, reassess the strategy and introduce new heuristics or tweak existing ones.
- **Balance:** Maintain a balance between exploitation of known good solutions and exploration of new possibilities to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

This guide provides a flexible and iterative framework for heuristic selection and execution, enabling you to experiment with different strategies and find the most effective approach for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

Before this discuss, we have already 1 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since the current solution has not been developed at all (all jobs are unfinished with zero makespan), it would be beneficial to start with a priority-based heuristic. This category can quickly provide a feasible initial solution by prioritizing job scheduling based on specific criteria, like shortest processing time or least work remaining. Establishing a baseline with priority-based heuristics will set the stage for further refinement in subsequent phases.

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(priority_based). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,random_search

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(priority_based,local_optimization,random_search)
explanation:xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:priority_based
explanation: The initial solution is in its early stages, with only one operation scheduled and no jobs completed. Priority-based heuristics are effective in quickly building an initial feasible solution. Continuing with this category can help develop the schedule further by prioritizing operations that can reduce the makespan or balance machine utilization. This will allow us to establish a more structured baseline before moving to more refined or exploratory approaches.
