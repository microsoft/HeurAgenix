In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\ndef first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP.

Here's an analysis of the scenarios best suited for each heuristic:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the current schedule is near optimal, and small adjustments are needed to fine-tune the makespan. Especially useful when operations are already in a good sequence, but minor improvements can be achieved by shifting operations within the same machine.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: The potential reduction in makespan after small shifts; applicable in scenarios where machines have varying idle times that can be minimized.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the goal is to minimize the average waiting time for jobs. Best for environments where shorter jobs can be completed quickly, allowing resources to be freed up for longer jobs.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: The number of short processing time operations remaining; beneficial in systems where rapid throughput of small tasks is prioritized.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the schedule has room for significant improvements, especially in complex schedules where multiple swaps can lead to reduced makespan.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Potential reduction in makespan from complex swaps; useful when the initial schedule is far from optimal.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: In scenarios where longer jobs may block the system, scheduling them first can prevent bottlenecks later on.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Total processing time of remaining operations; applicable when long jobs could lead to system congestion if delayed.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for iteratively improving a schedule by reducing makespan through strategic swaps, especially in early stages of scheduling.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Reduction in makespan through pairwise swaps; best when the schedule is in a state that can be improved by swapping non-adjacent operations.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for diversification during search processes, such as in metaheuristic frameworks where escaping local optima is desired.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Randomness in job selection; applicable for exploratory phases of scheduling where no clear strategy is evident.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the aim is to ensure that jobs with the most work left are prioritized to avoid them becoming critical path bottlenecks.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining work; best when the risk of long jobs delaying completion is high.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When minimizing the makespan is crucial by ensuring that long operations start as soon as possible.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Length of the next operation to be scheduled; useful in scenarios where long operations are critical path determinants.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when the focus is on completing jobs quickly to free up resources, often used in systems with high job turnover.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Remaining processing time; beneficial when rapid job completion is prioritized over minimizing makespan.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Similar to shortest processing time first, but considers the entire job rather than individual operations.\n    - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining processing time for jobs; applicable in environments that benefit from rapid job completion and throughput.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Simple environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimality, useful in scenarios without significant variance in job sizes.\n    - **Quantifiable by**: Order of arrival; best in systems where job arrival time is critical and processing times are relatively uniform.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific types of job shop scheduling environments, determined by factors such as job length, arrival times, and the criticality of minimizing makespan or other performance metrics."
