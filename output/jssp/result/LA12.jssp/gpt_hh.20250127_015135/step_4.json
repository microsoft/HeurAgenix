In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Here's an analysis of the scenarios best suited for each heuristic:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the current schedule is near optimal, and small adjustments are needed to fine-tune the makespan. Especially useful when operations are already in a good sequence, but minor improvements can be achieved by shifting operations within the same machine.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: The potential reduction in makespan after small shifts; applicable in scenarios where machines have varying idle times that can be minimized.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the goal is to minimize the average waiting time for jobs. Best for environments where shorter jobs can be completed quickly, allowing resources to be freed up for longer jobs.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: The number of short processing time operations remaining; beneficial in systems where rapid throughput of small tasks is prioritized.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the schedule has room for significant improvements, especially in complex schedules where multiple swaps can lead to reduced makespan.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Potential reduction in makespan from complex swaps; useful when the initial schedule is far from optimal.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: In scenarios where longer jobs may block the system, scheduling them first can prevent bottlenecks later on.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Total processing time of remaining operations; applicable when long jobs could lead to system congestion if delayed.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for iteratively improving a schedule by reducing makespan through strategic swaps, especially in early stages of scheduling.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Reduction in makespan through pairwise swaps; best when the schedule is in a state that can be improved by swapping non-adjacent operations.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for diversification during search processes, such as in metaheuristic frameworks where escaping local optima is desired.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Randomness in job selection; applicable for exploratory phases of scheduling where no clear strategy is evident.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the aim is to ensure that jobs with the most work left are prioritized to avoid them becoming critical path bottlenecks.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining work; best when the risk of long jobs delaying completion is high.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When minimizing the makespan is crucial by ensuring that long operations start as soon as possible.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Length of the next operation to be scheduled; useful in scenarios where long operations are critical path determinants.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when the focus is on completing jobs quickly to free up resources, often used in systems with high job turnover.\n   - **Quantifiable by**: Remaining processing time; beneficial when rapid job completion is prioritized over minimizing makespan.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Similar to shortest processing time first, but considers the entire job rather than individual operations.\n    - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining processing time for jobs; applicable in environments that benefit from rapid job completion and throughput.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Simple environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimality, useful in scenarios without significant variance in job sizes.\n    - **Quantifiable by**: Order of arrival; best in systems where job arrival time is critical and processing times are relatively uniform.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific types of job shop scheduling environments, determined by factors such as job length, arrival times, and the criticality of minimizing makespan or other performance metrics."

This may complement the previous efforts and drive progress towards completing some jobs entirely.\nDelta of current_makespan: 109\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 5\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Since the least_work_remaining_66c9 heuristic has been applied and there is still a high proportion of unfinished jobs (95%), shifting focus to the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic might help to address potential bottlenecks from jobs with longer processing times. This can balance the workload and prevent long jobs from delaying the overall schedule, potentially reducing the makespan in the longer term.\nDelta of current_makespan: 89\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 5\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Continuing with the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic as it has demonstrated a reduction in makespan, indicating progress towards balancing workload and managing longer jobs that may become bottlenecks. This should help in further refining the solution and potentially lead to job completions.\nDelta of current_makespan: 207\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 5\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: longest_job_next_2e23. How does longest_job_next_2e23 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

However, no additional jobs have been completed in these rounds, suggesting that while progress is being made in terms of balancing workload, it hasn't yet led to job completions.\n   - The current proportion of unfinished jobs is still high at 95%, indicating that further work is needed to drive job completion.\n\n2. **Considerations for Next Steps**:\n   - Since the \"longest_job_next_2e23\" heuristic is showing some positive impact on makespan, it may be beneficial to continue with it for a few more steps to see if it can lead to job completions.\n   - Alternatively, a switch to a heuristic that focuses on completing jobs (such as \"least_work_remaining_66c9\") could be considered to complement the workload balancing achieved by \"longest_job_next_2e23\".\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the progress made with \"longest_job_next_2e23\" and the need to balance workload while pushing towards job completions, I recommend continuing with this heuristic for a few more steps.
