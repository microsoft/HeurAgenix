I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves finding an optimal order or arrangement of operations to be performed on machines. The use of heuristics and hyper-heuristics is a common approach to tackle such problems due to their complexity and the large search space involved. Your framework, with the Solution and Operator classes and the heuristic function signature, seems suitable for addressing this kind of problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable can help in selecting the right approach based on the specific characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem at hand. Here's an analysis of the scenarios best suited for each heuristic:

1. **shift_operator_109f**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the current schedule is near optimal, and small adjustments are needed to fine-tune the makespan. Especially useful when operations are already in a good sequence, but minor improvements can be achieved by shifting operations within the same machine.
   - **Quantifiable by**: The potential reduction in makespan after small shifts; applicable in scenarios where machines have varying idle times that can be minimized.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the goal is to minimize the average waiting time for jobs. Best for environments where shorter jobs can be completed quickly, allowing resources to be freed up for longer jobs.
   - **Quantifiable by**: The number of short processing time operations remaining; beneficial in systems where rapid throughput of small tasks is prioritized.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the schedule has room for significant improvements, especially in complex schedules where multiple swaps can lead to reduced makespan.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Potential reduction in makespan from complex swaps; useful when the initial schedule is far from optimal.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: In scenarios where longer jobs may block the system, scheduling them first can prevent bottlenecks later on.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Total processing time of remaining operations; applicable when long jobs could lead to system congestion if delayed.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for iteratively improving a schedule by reducing makespan through strategic swaps, especially in early stages of scheduling.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Reduction in makespan through pairwise swaps; best when the schedule is in a state that can be improved by swapping non-adjacent operations.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for diversification during search processes, such as in metaheuristic frameworks where escaping local optima is desired.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Randomness in job selection; applicable for exploratory phases of scheduling where no clear strategy is evident.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the aim is to ensure that jobs with the most work left are prioritized to avoid them becoming critical path bottlenecks.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining work; best when the risk of long jobs delaying completion is high.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When minimizing the makespan is crucial by ensuring that long operations start as soon as possible.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Length of the next operation to be scheduled; useful in scenarios where long operations are critical path determinants.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when the focus is on completing jobs quickly to free up resources, often used in systems with high job turnover.
   - **Quantifiable by**: Remaining processing time; beneficial when rapid job completion is prioritized over minimizing makespan.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Similar to shortest processing time first, but considers the entire job rather than individual operations.
    - **Quantifiable by**: Total remaining processing time for jobs; applicable in environments that benefit from rapid job completion and throughput.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Simple environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimality, useful in scenarios without significant variance in job sizes.
    - **Quantifiable by**: Order of arrival; best in systems where job arrival time is critical and processing times are relatively uniform.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific types of job shop scheduling environments, determined by factors such as job length, arrival times, and the criticality of minimizing makespan or other performance metrics.

Before this discuss, we have already 6 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Given that all jobs are currently unfinished and have not started, applying the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic can help in quickly reducing the number of unfinished jobs by focusing on those with the shortest operation times. This approach will help in freeing up resources more quickly, potentially allowing for better scheduling of longer tasks in subsequent steps.
Delta of current_makespan: 18
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 1---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Shifting focus to jobs with the least remaining work can lead to faster job completion, thereby freeing up resources and potentially reducing the overall makespan. This may complement the previous efforts and drive progress towards completing some jobs entirely.
Delta of current_makespan: 109
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Since the least_work_remaining_66c9 heuristic has been applied and there is still a high proportion of unfinished jobs (95%), shifting focus to the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic might help to address potential bottlenecks from jobs with longer processing times. This can balance the workload and prevent long jobs from delaying the overall schedule, potentially reducing the makespan in the longer term.
Delta of current_makespan: 89
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 3---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Continuing with the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic as it has demonstrated a reduction in makespan, indicating progress towards balancing workload and managing longer jobs that may become bottlenecks. This should help in further refining the solution and potentially lead to job completions.
Delta of current_makespan: 207
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 4---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Continuing with "longest_job_next_2e23" to further balance the workload and reduce makespan, with the aim of achieving job completions. The heuristic has shown promise in reducing makespan, and additional steps may help transition these improvements into completed jobs.
Delta of current_makespan: 82
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 5---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Switching to the shortest_processing_time_first_c374 heuristic aims to reduce the number of unfinished jobs by focusing on those with the shortest operation times. This approach can help free up resources faster and potentially lead to job completions, balancing the workload across machines and improving the overall schedule efficiency.
Delta of current_makespan: 41
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the current data and the progress made with the previous heuristics, here is my recommendation:

The **shortest_processing_time_first_c374** heuristic, applied in the last round, has shown a reduction in the makespan by 41 units and has contributed to advancing operations, although no additional jobs have been completed. Given that the makespan has consistently decreased with this heuristic and that there is still a high proportion of unfinished jobs (95%), it seems prudent to continue with this heuristic for a few more steps. This approach could potentially lead to further job completions and resource optimization.

Here is the proposed plan:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
running steps: 5
explanation: Continuing with the shortest_processing_time_first_c374 heuristic, as it has successfully reduced the makespan in the previous round. Further application is expected to decrease the number of unfinished jobs by focusing on operations with shorter processing times, thereby freeing up machine resources and potentially leading to job completions.
