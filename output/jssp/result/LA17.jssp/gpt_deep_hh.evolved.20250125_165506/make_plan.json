In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine.

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nDynamic Scoring: Heuristics in this class use dynamic scoring mechanisms to adapt their decision-making process based on current state and dataset characteristics.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP.

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\n\nLocal Optimization: These heuristics focus on local search techniques such as 2-opt or 3-opt moves and shifting operations to improve the current solution.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\n\nMakespan Reduction: Heuristics aimed at reducing the makespan by optimizing the order of operations or jobs.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we need to consider both the construction and improvement phases. Here's a framework for approaching this:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Initial Job Selection:**\n   - **Priority-Based Heuristics**: Begin with heuristics like `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish an initial schedule. These heuristics offer a quick way to prioritize jobs based on different criteria and help in setting a baseline schedule.\n   - **Dynamic Scoring Heuristics**: Utilize heuristics like `most_work_remaining_df20` to adaptively prioritize jobs based on real-time data, which can be particularly useful if the initial priority-based heuristics are not yielding satisfactory results.\n\n2. **Diverse Job Allocation:**\n   - **Random Selection**: Use `random_6512` intermittently to introduce diversity in job selection, which helps in avoiding premature convergence to suboptimal schedules.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Local Optimization:**\n   - **Local Optimization Heuristics**: Implement `_2opt_f9c1` and `shift_operator_109f` to refine the initial schedule. These heuristics focus on improving the schedule by making local changes that aim to reduce the makespan.\n   - **Makespan Reduction Heuristics**: Utilize these, particularly `most_work_remaining_df20` in conjunction with local optimization techniques, to specifically target and reduce the overall makespan.\n\n2. **Iterative Enhancement:**\n   - **Combination of Local Optimization and Dynamic Scoring**: Alternate between local optimization and dynamic scoring heuristics to iteratively enhance the schedule. This could involve swapping, shifting, or reversing sequences to find a better solution.\n\n3. **Evaluation and Adjustment:**\n   - Regularly evaluate the performance of the current heuristic using metrics such as makespan, machine utilization, and job diversity.\n   - Adjust the heuristic strategy based on performance feedback. If a particular heuristic is underperforming, switch to another category or combination of heuristics.\n\n### Execution Strategy\n\n- **Experimentation and Adaptation**: Begin with a diverse set of heuristics from different categories and assess their performance. Use a systematic approach to record performance metrics and adaptively switch heuristics based on their effectiveness.\n- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine different heuristic strategies within a single phase. For instance, start with a priority-based heuristic for initial job selection and then switch to dynamic scoring or makespan reduction heuristics for refinement.\n- **Iterative Testing**: Regularly test and evaluate the impact of different heuristics on the solution. This will provide insights into which heuristics are most effective for the specific problem characteristics and allow for informed decisions about which heuristics to prioritize in future iterations.\n\nThis strategic guide aims to provide a flexible and adaptive framework for solving JSSP, enabling the exploration of various heuristic approaches and optimizing their application based on performance feedback."
