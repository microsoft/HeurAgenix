I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves finding an optimal sequence of operations for a set of jobs on a set of machines. The use of heuristics is a common approach to solve such problems due to their complexity and the impracticality of exhaustive search methods in larger instances. Your framework of using operators to modify solutions in the pursuit of optimizing a schedule aligns with common heuristic strategies used to tackle combinatorial optimization problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Here's an analysis of scenarios where each of the heuristics you've implemented might be applicable, along with considerations for quantifying these scenarios:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) with Dynamic Scoring (d471):**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable for environments where minimizing individual operation times can lead to a reduction in overall makespan. Effective when job times vary significantly.
   - **Quantification:** High variance in operation times across jobs, and jobs with shorter operations can be completed quickly to free up resources.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) with Dynamic Scoring (af26):**
   - **Scenario:** Useful in systems prioritizing fairness or when job arrival times are critical. Can be adapted for diverse datasets.
   - **Quantification:** High job arrival rate with minimal variance in operation times, or when fairness in job completion time is a priority.

3. **Most Work Remaining (df20):**
   - **Scenario:** Effective in scenarios where larger jobs need prioritization to prevent bottlenecking machine resources.
   - **Quantification:** Jobs with significantly varying total work requirements, especially where large jobs can delay the system if not prioritized.

4. **Shift Operator (109f):**
   - **Scenario:** Applicable when small adjustments in job sequences can lead to significant improvements in makespan.
   - **Quantification:** Systems with moderate flexibility in job sequences and where minor shifts can optimize resource utilization.

5. **3-opt Heuristic (6ee0):**
   - **Scenario:** Best for systems where significant changes in job sequences are needed to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.
   - **Quantification:** High complexity in job interactions and when exploration of multiple sequences is feasible.

6. **Longest Job Next (2e23):**
   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs with the most processing time to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification:** Dominance of a few jobs in total processing time and when their delay could impact overall schedule efficiency.

7. **2-opt Heuristic (f9c1):**
   - **Scenario:** Similar to 3-opt but with less computational overhead, suitable for moderate adjustments.
   - **Quantification:** Systems with potential for sequence optimization but limited computational resources.

8. **Random Selection (6512):**
   - **Scenario:** Useful for initial exploration of solution space or when no clear heuristic advantage is apparent.
   - **Quantification:** High uncertainty or when other heuristics don't yield improvements, introducing randomness can diversify search.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (9dc9):**
   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes operations with longer processing times to maximize resource utilization and minimize idle times.
   - **Quantification:** High variance in operation times and when longer operations can lead to resource underutilization.

10. **Least Work Remaining (66c9):**
    - **Scenario:** Focuses on quickly completing jobs with minimal remaining work, often to free up system resources.
    - **Quantification:** Low remaining work variance across jobs and when quick job turnover is beneficial.

11. **Shortest Job Next (5b42):**
    - **Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs that can be completed quickly, reducing the number of active jobs and potentially freeing up resources.
    - **Quantification:** Systems with many small jobs and low variance in job sizes, where quick turnovers are advantageous.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best applied in contexts that align with its underlying logic. Quantifying scenarios typically involves analyzing job size variance, arrival rates, and the impact of job completion on overall system performance.

Before this discuss, we have already 4 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state, where no jobs have been processed yet, starting with the Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) heuristic can help establish an initial schedule by focusing on shorter operations. This approach is beneficial in reducing idle times and quickly transitioning jobs through the system, especially when there's high variance in operation times, as indicated by the standard deviation of operation times.
Delta of current_makespan: 109
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows no finished jobs and a high variance in job completion times, suggesting that focusing on jobs with the most work remaining could help balance the workload across machines and reduce potential bottlenecks. This heuristic can help to optimize the makespan by prioritizing jobs that are more likely to cause delays if not addressed early. By running this for 10 steps, we aim to incrementally improve the solution by prioritizing high-impact jobs.
Delta of current_makespan: 113
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 9
---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Switching to "shortest_job_next_5b42" to focus on quickly completing jobs with minimal remaining work, which may help reduce the makespan and increase the number of finished jobs. This approach leverages the current high variance in job completion times to optimize resource utilization and streamline job flow.
Delta of current_makespan: 193
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 3---
Heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous application of the "shortest_job_next_5b42" heuristic resulted in completing one job and reducing the makespan, indicating its effectiveness in the current state. With a high proportion of unfinished jobs (90%) and a considerable standard deviation in job completion times, continuing with this heuristic can quickly complete more jobs, streamline operations, and further reduce the makespan.
Delta of current_makespan: 265
Delta of Finished Job Num: 2
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_job_next_5b42. How does shortest_job_next_5b42 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state and progress, let's evaluate the situation and make a decision on the next steps:

1. **Current Data and Performance:**
   - The application of "shortest_job_next_5b42" has been effective in reducing the makespan and increasing the number of completed jobs.
   - The standard deviation in job completion times is still high, indicating there's room for improvement by focusing on completing more jobs quickly.

2. **Considerations for Next Steps:**
   - Continuing with "shortest_job_next_5b42" seems reasonable given its recent success in completing jobs and reducing the makespan.
   - Further application of this heuristic could continue to streamline the job flow and further optimize resource utilization.

3. **Decision:**
   - Given the performance of the "shortest_job_next_5b42" heuristic, it would be strategic to run it for additional steps to capitalize on its current momentum in the context of high unfinished jobs.

Here is the decision based on the analysis:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
running steps: 10
explanation: Continuing with "shortest_job_next_5b42" as it has been effective in reducing the makespan and completing jobs. With a significant portion of jobs still unfinished and high variance in completion times, further application is likely to yield additional improvements.
