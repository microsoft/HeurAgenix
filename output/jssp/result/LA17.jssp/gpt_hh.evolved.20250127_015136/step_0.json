In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Effective when job times vary significantly.\n   - **Quantification:** High variance in operation times across jobs, and jobs with shorter operations can be completed quickly to free up resources.\n\n2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) with Dynamic Scoring (af26):**\n   - **Scenario:** Useful in systems prioritizing fairness or when job arrival times are critical. Can be adapted for diverse datasets.\n   - **Quantification:** High job arrival rate with minimal variance in operation times, or when fairness in job completion time is a priority.\n\n3. **Most Work Remaining (df20):**\n   - **Scenario:** Effective in scenarios where larger jobs need prioritization to prevent bottlenecking machine resources.\n   - **Quantification:** Jobs with significantly varying total work requirements, especially where large jobs can delay the system if not prioritized.\n\n4. **Shift Operator (109f):**\n   - **Scenario:** Applicable when small adjustments in job sequences can lead to significant improvements in makespan.\n   - **Quantification:** Systems with moderate flexibility in job sequences and where minor shifts can optimize resource utilization.\n\n5. **3-opt Heuristic (6ee0):**\n   - **Scenario:** Best for systems where significant changes in job sequences are needed to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.\n   - **Quantification:** High complexity in job interactions and when exploration of multiple sequences is feasible.\n\n6. **Longest Job Next (2e23):**\n   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs with the most processing time to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks.\n   - **Quantification:** Dominance of a few jobs in total processing time and when their delay could impact overall schedule efficiency.\n\n7. **2-opt Heuristic (f9c1):**\n   - **Scenario:** Similar to 3-opt but with less computational overhead, suitable for moderate adjustments.\n   - **Quantification:** Systems with potential for sequence optimization but limited computational resources.\n\n8. **Random Selection (6512):**\n   - **Scenario:** Useful for initial exploration of solution space or when no clear heuristic advantage is apparent.\n   - **Quantification:** High uncertainty or when other heuristics don't yield improvements, introducing randomness can diversify search.\n\n9. **Longest Processing Time First (9dc9):**\n   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes operations with longer processing times to maximize resource utilization and minimize idle times.\n   - **Quantification:** High variance in operation times and when longer operations can lead to resource underutilization.\n\n10. **Least Work Remaining (66c9):**\n    - **Scenario:** Focuses on quickly completing jobs with minimal remaining work, often to free up system resources.\n    - **Quantification:** Low remaining work variance across jobs and when quick job turnover is beneficial.\n\n11. **Shortest Job Next (5b42):**\n    - **Scenario:** Prioritizes jobs that can be completed quickly, reducing the number of active jobs and potentially freeing up resources.\n    - **Quantification:** Systems with many small jobs and low variance in job sizes, where quick turnovers are advantageous.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best applied in contexts that align with its underlying logic.
