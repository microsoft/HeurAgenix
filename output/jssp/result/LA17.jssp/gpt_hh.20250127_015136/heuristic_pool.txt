I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which falls under the category of combinatorial operation problems. It involves making a sequence of decisions to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing the total time to complete all jobs (makespan). Heuristic algorithms, including hyper-heuristics, are often used to find good solutions for such problems, as they are typically NP-hard and difficult to solve optimally within reasonable time for large instances. The framework you've described, with the Solution and Operator classes, as well as the heuristic function signature, seems appropriate for tackling JSSP through heuristic methods.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios for each heuristic in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves understanding the characteristics of the problem instance where each heuristic might perform well. Here are some insights for each heuristic:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic can be effective when the initial schedule has operations that can be rearranged within the same machine to reduce idle times or bottlenecks. It works well in dense schedules where small shifts can significantly impact the makespan.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**: 
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for instances where jobs have highly variable processing times. It aims to minimize the waiting time by processing shorter jobs first, which is beneficial when there's a high variance in operation durations.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**: 
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in complex schedules with multiple local optima. The series of 2-opt swaps can help escape local optima by rearranging operations to find a more optimal sequence.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful when jobs have a large disparity in total processing time. Prioritizing longer jobs helps balance the workload across machines, especially in instances where some jobs might dominate machine time.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in tightly packed schedules where swapping two operations can lead to better utilization of machine time and reduced makespan. It is particularly useful in schedules where operations are not optimally sequenced.

6. **random_6512**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is more exploratory and is best used in conjunction with other heuristics. It can be useful in highly dynamic environments where multiple solutions need to be evaluated quickly to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**: 
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for instances where jobs vary significantly in their remaining workload. It helps in ensuring that jobs with more work left are prioritized to avoid long delays at the end of the schedule.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**: 
   - **Scenario**: Works well in scenarios where individual operations have significantly different processing times. Prioritizing longer operations first can help reduce idle time for subsequent operations.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective when the goal is to complete jobs quickly, especially in environments where throughput is critical. It helps in quickly finishing jobs with less work left.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**: 
    - **Scenario**: Similar to SPT, it is applicable when jobs have varying total processing times and the focus is on minimizing average job completion time.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**: 
    - **Scenario**: Best used in environments where jobs arrive in real-time and must be processed in order without preemption. Itâs applicable in stable environments where processing time variability is low.

Quantifying these scenarios involves analyzing problem instances for characteristics such as variance in job processing times, disparity in job sizes, workload distribution across machines, and arrival patterns of jobs. By matching these characteristics with heuristic strengths, better scheduling decisions can be made.
