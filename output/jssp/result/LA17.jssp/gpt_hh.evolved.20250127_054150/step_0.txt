I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the best sequence of operations on machines to minimize objectives like makespan, total completion time, or tardiness, which are typical goals in combinatorial optimization. Heuristics and metaheuristics are commonly employed to tackle such problems due to their complexity and the vast solution space, making them suitable for your hyper-heuristic framework.

Your framework's structure with the `Solution` and various `Operator` classes appears appropriate for implementing heuristic strategies. The operators you've defined, such as `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, and `ShiftOperator`, are typical manipulations used in heuristic algorithms to explore the solution space effectively.

The function signature for the heuristic function seems well-designed for integrating with a hyper-heuristic approach, allowing flexibility in using various heuristics by providing necessary problem data and solution states.

Overall, your setup aligns well with solving a combinatorial operation problem like JSSP using heuristics.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves understanding the characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem instance and matching them with the strengths of each heuristic. Hereâs an overview of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances where minimizing the makespan is crucial, and jobs have varied processing times across machines.
   - **Quantification**: Best for scenarios where operations have large variances in processing times, and machine availability can be dynamically influenced by job selection.

2. **first_come_first_served_af26()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable to environments where fairness is emphasized, or the arrival order of jobs is significant.
   - **Quantification**: Useful in datasets where job arrival times need to be respected, or when adapting to new data dynamically is important.

3. **most_work_remaining_df20()**:
   - **Scenario**: Appropriate for situations where jobs have significantly different total processing times, and itâs crucial to prioritize longer jobs to avoid bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Best when there's a large disparity in job lengths, and delaying longer jobs would lead to increased makespan.

4. **shift_operator_109f()**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where small local improvements can lead to significant reductions in makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when the schedule is near optimal, and fine-tuning via local shifts is required.

5. **_3opt_6ee0()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in complex instances where local optima are prevalent, and breaking out of these is necessary for improvement.
   - **Quantification**: Best for large problem instances with many operations and when non-adjacent swaps can significantly impact the makespan.

6. **longest_job_next_2e23()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for situations where prioritizing longer jobs can help in balancing machine loads and reducing overall completion time.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when job lengths vary greatly, and focusing on longer jobs can prevent resource idleness.

7. **_2opt_f9c1()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in refining solutions by making small adjustments to operation sequences.
   - **Quantification**: Useful in moderately sized problems where iterative improvements can lead to better solutions.

8. **random_6512()**:
   - **Scenario**: Beneficial in exploratory phases or when seeking diversity in solution approaches.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal when the solution space is vast, and exploration is needed to identify promising regions.

9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for environments where operations with long processing times dominate the scheduling constraints.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable when certain operations have significantly longer processing times, impacting the makespan heavily.

10. **least_work_remaining_66c9()**:
    - **Scenario**: Favorable in contexts where quickly finishing shorter jobs can free up resources.
    - **Quantification**: Best when there are many short jobs that can be quickly completed to reduce the overall system load.

11. **shortest_job_next_5b42()**:
    - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where quickly completing the shortest jobs can lead to a faster throughput.
    - **Quantification**: Applicable when the job lengths are uneven, and finishing short jobs quickly can help in optimizing the schedule.

By understanding the characteristics and demands of the specific job shop scheduling instance, the appropriate heuristic can be chosen to leverage its strengths effectively.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Given the current state of the problem and the characteristics of the job and machine operation times, we need to select a heuristic that can effectively start building a solution from scratch, as no jobs have been scheduled yet. The variance in operation times suggests that a heuristic that considers operation times might be beneficial initially. Therefore, a suitable starting point could be the "shortest_processing_time_first_d471" heuristic, as it aims to minimize makespan by initially focusing on operations with shorter processing times.

Here's the proposed next step:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
running steps: 10
explanation: We are starting with no scheduled jobs, and this heuristic is well-suited for making initial scheduling decisions by minimizing the makespan through dynamic evaluation of unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability and processing times.
