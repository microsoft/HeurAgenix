In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\ndef first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP.

Below is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable:\n\n1. **Shift Operator**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful when a slight rearrangement within the same machine's queue can lead to significant improvements in the overall schedule. \n   - **Quantification**: Best for instances where operations are tightly packed, and minor shifts can reduce idle time.\n\n2. **Shortest Processing Time First**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when minimizing the makespan is critical, and there are several jobs with significantly varying processing times.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for instances with a wide range of operation times, where shorter tasks can be interspersed to fill gaps and reduce idle machine time.\n\n3. **3-opt Heuristic**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the schedule is suboptimal due to poor sequencing of operations, and there's room for substantial restructuring.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for complex instances where initial solutions have many inefficiencies in sequence.\n\n4. **Longest Job Next**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when long jobs need to be prioritized to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks later in the schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for instances with a few jobs that have disproportionately long total processing times.\n\n5. **2-opt Heuristic**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective for local optimization, where swapping two operations can lead to an improved makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Works well in instances where initial solutions are close to optimal, and small tweaks are needed.\n\n6. **Random**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful in stochastic environments or when the problem space is poorly understood, providing diverse initial solutions.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for generating varied solutions quickly in exploratory phases.\n\n7. **Most Work Remaining**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when it's crucial to address the jobs that will take the longest to complete if left unattended.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for instances with a large disparity in the remaining work of jobs.\n\n8. **Longest Processing Time First**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when there's a need to balance the load across machines by scheduling longer operations earlier.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for instances where long operations can cause machine bottlenecks if not scheduled early.\n\n9. **Least Work Remaining**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective for quickly getting jobs out of the queue, potentially freeing up resources for larger tasks.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for instances where several small jobs can be completed quickly to reduce complexity.\n\n10. **Shortest Job Next**:\n    - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where job completion speed is prioritized over the overall schedule.\n    - **Quantification**: Best for instances with many small jobs that can be completed quickly to improve throughput.\n\n11. **First Come First Served**:\n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in systems where fairness or simplicity is prioritized, such as in service-oriented environments.\n    - **Quantification**: Suitable for instances where job arrival times are a critical component of the scheduling policy.\n\nEach heuristic has strengths and weaknesses that can be leveraged based on the specific characteristics of the JSSP instance being solved.
