This is especially useful given the high variance in operation times, allowing us to fill machine queues efficiently and reduce idle times. Running it for 15 steps will cover one operation for each job, helping to quickly establish a baseline schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 206\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 15\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state with all jobs unfinished and a high variance in operation times, utilizing the Shift Operator heuristic can effectively refine the existing schedule by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue. This approach aims to reduce the current makespan of 206 by optimizing the sequence of operations, particularly in machines with high completion times. Running it for 10 steps allows for targeted adjustments while assessing the impact on the makespan and overall job completion.\nDelta of current_makespan: -46\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current solution state, there is room for improvement in reducing the makespan further. The previous application of the shift_operator_109f successfully reduced the makespan by 46 units, indicating that local adjustments can yield significant improvements. The 2-opt heuristic is effective for making local optimizations by swapping operations to achieve a shorter sequence. Running it for 10 steps allows us to explore potential gains in efficiency without overly perturbing the current schedule. This should help in further reducing the makespan and moving towards a more optimal solution.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The previous application of the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic did not yield any immediate improvements in makespan, indicating that the current local adjustments may not have been sufficient. Given the substantial variance in job operation times and the current makespan of 160, there is potential for further optimization. Continuing with the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic for an additional 15 steps could allow us to explore more swap combinations that might unlock a more efficient job sequence. This approach aims to further refine the solution by identifying swaps that were not considered in the previous round, potentially leading to improvements in the makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, where the last rounds of the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic did not yield further improvements, it's strategic to shift focus. The Longest Job Next heuristic is selected to prioritize jobs with the longest total processing time remaining. This approach may help in uncovering bottlenecks and potentially reducing the makespan by addressing these longer jobs early, allowing for better overall resource allocation and efficiency.\nDelta of current_makespan: 219\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Switching back to the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic aims to reduce idle times by prioritizing shorter operations, which can help refine the schedule and potentially improve the makespan. Running for 10 steps will allow us to assess its effectiveness in optimizing the current solution further.\nDelta of current_makespan: 162\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has shown effectiveness in reducing idle times and advancing operations efficiently. Continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could further optimize the schedule by filling gaps and reducing the makespan, especially given the high variance in operation times.\nDelta of current_makespan: 282\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 3\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, where the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has been effective in advancing operations and reducing idle times, it is strategic to apply the `shift_operator_109f`. This heuristic can further refine the schedule by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue, potentially reducing the makespan and improving machine utilization. Running it for 10 steps allows for targeted adjustments, which could enhance the current solution's efficiency, given the substantial variance in operation times and the current makespan of 282.\nDelta of current_makespan: -203\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `shift_operator_109f` heuristic has shown considerable promise in reducing the makespan by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue. Given the recent success and the current state of the solution, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could lead to further improvements in the schedule, potentially optimizing machine utilization and reducing idle times.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The shift_operator_109f has reached a plateau in effectiveness, suggesting a need to explore additional swap combinations that might have been overlooked. The 2-opt heuristic is well-suited for this purpose, as it can make localized improvements by swapping operations, potentially leading to a reduced makespan. Running it for 10 steps allows us to explore this potential without significant disruption to the current solution.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The recent rounds using the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic have not yielded improvements, indicating that further local swaps may not be effective at this stage. Given the current makespan and the progress made with other heuristics, it may be beneficial to prioritize jobs with the longest total processing time remaining. By focusing on these jobs, we can potentially address any bottlenecks they may be causing and improve overall resource allocation. Running the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic for 10 steps will help us explore this strategy and possibly enhance the current solution.\nDelta of current_makespan: 219\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has previously demonstrated success in efficiently advancing operations and reducing idle times. Given the high variance in operation times, returning to this heuristic could further optimize the current schedule and potentially reduce the makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 152\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 4\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has been effective in previous rounds at advancing operations efficiently and reducing idle times. Given the current state and high variance in operation times, continuing with this heuristic for an additional 10 steps could further optimize the schedule by focusing on shorter operations, potentially reducing the makespan and improving resource utilization.\nDelta of current_makespan: 130\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 7\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has effectively reduced idle times and advanced operations efficiently.

How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
