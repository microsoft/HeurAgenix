I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations across multiple machines, which is characteristic of combinatorial operation problems. JSSP is well-suited to be addressed using heuristic algorithms, as exact methods can be computationally expensive for large instances. Your framework for Solution and Operator classes, along with the heuristic function signature, appears to be a reasonable approach for tackling JSSP using hyper-heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The heuristics you've implemented for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) are diverse and can be applied to different scenarios depending on the characteristics of the problem instance. Below is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable:

1. **Shift Operator**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful when a slight rearrangement within the same machine's queue can lead to significant improvements in the overall schedule. 
   - **Quantification**: Best for instances where operations are tightly packed, and minor shifts can reduce idle time.

2. **Shortest Processing Time First**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when minimizing the makespan is critical, and there are several jobs with significantly varying processing times.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for instances with a wide range of operation times, where shorter tasks can be interspersed to fill gaps and reduce idle machine time.

3. **3-opt Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the schedule is suboptimal due to poor sequencing of operations, and there's room for substantial restructuring.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for complex instances where initial solutions have many inefficiencies in sequence.

4. **Longest Job Next**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when long jobs need to be prioritized to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks later in the schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Best for instances with a few jobs that have disproportionately long total processing times.

5. **2-opt Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for local optimization, where swapping two operations can lead to an improved makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Works well in instances where initial solutions are close to optimal, and small tweaks are needed.

6. **Random**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in stochastic environments or when the problem space is poorly understood, providing diverse initial solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for generating varied solutions quickly in exploratory phases.

7. **Most Work Remaining**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when it's crucial to address the jobs that will take the longest to complete if left unattended.
   - **Quantification**: Best for instances with a large disparity in the remaining work of jobs.

8. **Longest Processing Time First**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when there's a need to balance the load across machines by scheduling longer operations earlier.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for instances where long operations can cause machine bottlenecks if not scheduled early.

9. **Least Work Remaining**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for quickly getting jobs out of the queue, potentially freeing up resources for larger tasks.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for instances where several small jobs can be completed quickly to reduce complexity.

10. **Shortest Job Next**:
    - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where job completion speed is prioritized over the overall schedule.
    - **Quantification**: Best for instances with many small jobs that can be completed quickly to improve throughput.

11. **First Come First Served**:
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in systems where fairness or simplicity is prioritized, such as in service-oriented environments.
    - **Quantification**: Suitable for instances where job arrival times are a critical component of the scheduling policy.

Each heuristic has strengths and weaknesses that can be leveraged based on the specific characteristics of the JSSP instance being solved. Understanding these scenarios and quantifying them can guide the selection of the most appropriate heuristic for a given problem.

Before this discuss, we have already 18 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: Given that all jobs are unfinished and we are at the initial stage, the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic is suitable for quickly advancing operations with the shortest time, which can help establish an initial structure for the schedule. This is especially useful given the high variance in operation times, allowing us to fill machine queues efficiently and reduce idle times. Running it for 15 steps will cover one operation for each job, helping to quickly establish a baseline schedule.
Delta of current_makespan: 206
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 15
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state with all jobs unfinished and a high variance in operation times, utilizing the Shift Operator heuristic can effectively refine the existing schedule by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue. This approach aims to reduce the current makespan of 206 by optimizing the sequence of operations, particularly in machines with high completion times. Running it for 10 steps allows for targeted adjustments while assessing the impact on the makespan and overall job completion.
Delta of current_makespan: -46
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current solution state, there is room for improvement in reducing the makespan further. The previous application of the shift_operator_109f successfully reduced the makespan by 46 units, indicating that local adjustments can yield significant improvements. The 2-opt heuristic is effective for making local optimizations by swapping operations to achieve a shorter sequence. Running it for 10 steps allows us to explore potential gains in efficiency without overly perturbing the current schedule. This should help in further reducing the makespan and moving towards a more optimal solution.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The previous application of the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic did not yield any immediate improvements in makespan, indicating that the current local adjustments may not have been sufficient. Given the substantial variance in job operation times and the current makespan of 160, there is potential for further optimization. Continuing with the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic for an additional 15 steps could allow us to explore more swap combinations that might unlock a more efficient job sequence. This approach aims to further refine the solution by identifying swaps that were not considered in the previous round, potentially leading to improvements in the makespan.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state, where the last rounds of the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic did not yield further improvements, it's strategic to shift focus. The Longest Job Next heuristic is selected to prioritize jobs with the longest total processing time remaining. This approach may help in uncovering bottlenecks and potentially reducing the makespan by addressing these longer jobs early, allowing for better overall resource allocation and efficiency.
Delta of current_makespan: 219
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 5---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Switching back to the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic aims to reduce idle times by prioritizing shorter operations, which can help refine the schedule and potentially improve the makespan. Running for 10 steps will allow us to assess its effectiveness in optimizing the current solution further.
Delta of current_makespan: 162
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 6---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has shown effectiveness in reducing idle times and advancing operations efficiently. Continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could further optimize the schedule by filling gaps and reducing the makespan, especially given the high variance in operation times.
Delta of current_makespan: 282
Delta of Finished Job Num: 3
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 7---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state, where the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has been effective in advancing operations and reducing idle times, it is strategic to apply the `shift_operator_109f`. This heuristic can further refine the schedule by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue, potentially reducing the makespan and improving machine utilization. Running it for 10 steps allows for targeted adjustments, which could enhance the current solution's efficiency, given the substantial variance in operation times and the current makespan of 282.
Delta of current_makespan: -203
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 8---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `shift_operator_109f` heuristic has shown considerable promise in reducing the makespan by rearranging operations within the same machine's queue. Given the recent success and the current state of the solution, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could lead to further improvements in the schedule, potentially optimizing machine utilization and reducing idle times.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 9---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The shift_operator_109f has reached a plateau in effectiveness, suggesting a need to explore additional swap combinations that might have been overlooked. The 2-opt heuristic is well-suited for this purpose, as it can make localized improvements by swapping operations, potentially leading to a reduced makespan. Running it for 10 steps allows us to explore this potential without significant disruption to the current solution.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 10---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The recent rounds using the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic have not yielded improvements, indicating that further local swaps may not be effective at this stage. Given the current makespan and the progress made with other heuristics, it may be beneficial to prioritize jobs with the longest total processing time remaining. By focusing on these jobs, we can potentially address any bottlenecks they may be causing and improve overall resource allocation. Running the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic for 10 steps will help us explore this strategy and possibly enhance the current solution.

Explain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has previously demonstrated success in efficiently advancing operations and reducing idle times. Given the high variance in operation times, returning to this heuristic could further optimize the current schedule and potentially reduce the makespan.

Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has been effective in previous rounds at advancing operations efficiently and reducing idle times. Given the current state and high variance in operation times, continuing with this heuristic for an additional 10 steps could further optimize the schedule by focusing on shorter operations, potentially reducing the makespan and improving resource utilization.

Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has effectively reduced idle times and advanced operations efficiently. Continuing with it for an additional 5 steps will allow us to explore further improvements in makespan, given the current state and high variance in operation times. This approach aims to incrementally optimize the schedule by prioritizing shorter operations.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 14---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The recent rounds have shown that the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic has not significantly improved the makespan. The `shift_operator_109f`, however, has previously demonstrated its ability to optimize the schedule by rearranging operations within machine queues. Given the high variance in operation times and the current makespan stability, running the `shift_operator_109f` for an additional 5 steps could help to further refine the sequence and potentially reduce idle times, enhancing overall efficiency.

Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The `shift_operator_109f` has shown promise in reducing the makespan by optimizing the sequence of operations within machine queues. Running it for an additional 5 steps allows us to explore further improvements without overcommitting resources, given the current high makespan and variance in operation times.

Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 16---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The shift_operator_109f has shown its capability in reducing the makespan by optimizing the sequence of operations within machine queues. Continuing with this heuristic for 10 more steps allows us to explore potential improvements while maintaining a balanced approach to resource allocation. This should help in further refining the schedule and reducing idle times.

Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The shift_operator_109f has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the makespan through local optimizations within machine queues. Given the current state where other heuristics have plateaued, applying shift_operator_109f for 10 additional steps may uncover further improvements by fine-tuning the sequence of operations, potentially reducing idle times and enhancing overall machine utilization.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shift_operator_109f
running steps: 10
hype parameter(optional): 
explanation: The `shift_operator_109f` heuristic has shown effectiveness in reducing the makespan through local optimizations within machine queues. While recent rounds have plateaued, the heuristic's ability to rearrange operations could still uncover latent inefficiencies. Running it for an additional 10 steps allows us to explore potential improvements in the sequence without significant disruption to the existing solution, particularly given the high variance in operation times and the current solution stability.
