I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves making a sequence of decisions to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing the makespan. The framework you've described, including the Solution and Operator classes, is consistent with common approaches to solving JSSP using heuristic methods. The use of operators to modify solutions and the heuristic function signature aligns with typical strategies for tackling such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): time_optimization,job_priority,local_search,fallback_scenarios

time_optimization: these heuristics focus on optimizing the processing time of operations to improve makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

job_priority: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on the amount of work remaining or processing time.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.

local_search: these heuristics apply local search techniques such as swaps and shifts to refine the solution.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

fallback_scenarios: these heuristics include logic to handle scenarios with low job diversity or a single unfinished job.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:15
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], [3, 1, 4, 0, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [4, 2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 4, 2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]]
job_operation_time:[[21, 34, 95, 53, 55], [52, 16, 71, 26, 21], [31, 12, 42, 39, 98], [77, 77, 79, 55, 66], [37, 34, 64, 19, 83], [43, 54, 92, 62, 79], [93, 69, 87, 77, 87], [60, 41, 38, 83, 24], [98, 17, 25, 44, 49], [96, 77, 79, 75, 43], [28, 35, 95, 76, 7], [61, 10, 95, 9, 35], [59, 16, 91, 59, 46], [43, 52, 28, 27, 50], [87, 45, 39, 9, 41]]
total_operation_num:75
average_operation_time:53.22666666666667
max_operation_time:98
min_operation_time:7
std_deviation_operation_time:26.382607065177535
job_operation_time_range:91
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To create a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we can structure the process into two main phases: Construction and Improvement. Each phase will have specific goals and heuristic categories to consider. The approach is iterative, allowing for flexibility and adaptability based on performance assessments.

### Construction Phase
**Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution.

1. **Category: Time Optimization**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Start with heuristics that focus on minimizing makespan, such as `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to quickly schedule operations with short processing times.
     - Alternate with `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` to ensure that long operations do not bottleneck the schedule.
     - Assess the initial solution in terms of makespan and machine utilization.

2. **Category: Job Priority**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Use `most_work_remaining_df20` to prioritize jobs with significant work left, balancing the load across machines.
     - Switch to `least_work_remaining_66c9` as needed to finish jobs that are close to completion.
     - Evaluate the solutionâs progress and switch categories if improvements stagnate.

3. **Category: Fallback Scenarios**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Use `first_come_first_served_af26` as a fallback when job diversity is low or a straightforward approach is needed.
     - Apply `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to handle scenarios with one or few unfinished jobs.

### Improvement Phase
**Objective:** Refine the initial solution to optimize the objective further.

1. **Category: Local Search**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Begin with `_2opt_f9c1` to explore simple swaps that may reduce makespan.
     - Gradually transition to `_3opt_6ee0` for more complex local improvements if the solution stagnates.
     - Use `shift_operator_109f` to make fine-grained adjustments, especially on machines with high waiting times.

2. **Category: Time Optimization and Job Priority (combined)**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Reassess the solution using time optimization and job priority heuristics to ensure no further improvements can be made.
     - Alternate between `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` and `longest_job_next_2e23` to test their effectiveness on the refined solution.

3. **Category: Fallback Scenarios**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Reapply `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` if the solution becomes stuck in a local optimum.
     - These heuristics can provide a fresh perspective or escape from stagnation.

### Iterative Approach
- **Evaluation:** After each heuristic application, evaluate the makespan, machine utilization, and overall job completion status.
- **Switching Heuristics:** If a heuristic does not show improvement within a few iterations, switch to another within the same category or move to a different category.
- **Experimentation:** Regularly experiment with different combinations of heuristics to identify synergies and enhance solution quality.

This strategic guide aims to provide a flexible framework that can adapt to different problem instances and solution states. By iteratively alternating between heuristics and phases, the approach seeks to avoid dependency on any single method and encourages exploration of diverse algorithmic strategies for effective problem-solving.

job_operation_time:[[21, 34, 95, 53, 55], [52, 16, 71, 26, 21], [31, 12, 42, 39, 98], [77, 77, 79, 55, 66], [37, 34, 64, 19, 83], [43, 54, 92, 62, 79], [93, 69, 87, 77, 87], [60, 41, 38, 83, 24], [98, 17, 25, 44, 49], [96, 77, 79, 75, 43], [28, 35, 95, 76, 7], [61, 10, 95, 9, 35], [59, 16, 91, 59, 46], [43, 52, 28, 27, 50], [87, 45, 39, 9, 41]]

proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: None(None). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: time_optimization,job_priority,local_search,fallback_scenarios

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:time_optimization
explanation:Given that the current solution has not yet started (all operations are unfinished, and the makespan is zero), it is advisable to begin with a construction heuristic focused on time optimization. This will help in establishing an initial feasible solution by prioritizing operations that can quickly contribute to reducing the makespan. Starting with time optimization can set a strong foundation for further improvements.
