In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently.

Each phase will have specific goals and heuristic categories to consider.

By iteratively alternating between heuristics and phases, the approach seeks to avoid dependency on any single method and encourages exploration of diverse algorithmic strategies for effective problem-solving."

This will help in establishing an initial feasible solution by prioritizing operations that can quickly contribute to reducing the makespan. Starting with time optimization can set a strong foundation for further improvements.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->21\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nHeuristic Category: time_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has just started, with only one operation completed and a makespan of 21. At this early stage, it is beneficial to continue building the initial solution using time optimization heuristics. Focusing on time optimization will help prioritize operations that can quickly reduce the makespan and establish a solid foundation for subsequent improvement phases. This approach will ensure that operations are scheduled efficiently, leveraging the available machine capacity to its fullest potential.\ncurrent_makespan: 21->52\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42\nHeuristic Category: job_priority\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the initial solution has begun to take shape with two operations completed and the makespan at 52, it is beneficial to diversify the heuristic approach. Switching to a job_priority category can help balance the workload and focus on jobs with the most or least work remaining. This approach can promote progress by ensuring that operations for critical jobs are prioritized, potentially leading to a more balanced schedule and better machine utilization. This strategic switch can enhance the current solution by addressing any potential bottlenecks in job completion.\ncurrent_makespan: 52->93\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_search\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has made some progress with a makespan of 93, but no jobs have been completed yet, and the machine utilization is not optimal. Given that the construction phase has already utilized both time optimization and job priority heuristics, it might be beneficial to switch to the local_search category. Local search heuristics, such as _2opt_f9c1 or shift_operator_109f, can help refine the current solution by exploring nearby solutions and potentially reducing the makespan further. This approach can optimize the current schedule by addressing inefficiencies and improving machine utilization, leading to overall better performance.\ncurrent_makespan: 93->93\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->3\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nHeuristic Category: job_priority\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where the makespan is 93 with no jobs completed and machine utilization is suboptimal, switching back to the job_priority category could help balance the workload. This approach can prioritize unfinished jobs that have the least or most work remaining, potentially leading to a more balanced schedule and improved machine utilization. Addressing these aspects can enhance the solution by promoting progress in job completion and reducing idle times across machines.\ncurrent_makespan: 93->93\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nmachine_0: 6\nmachine_1: 0\nmachine_2: 2\nmachine_3: 1\nmachine_4: \n\nfinished_jobs:[]\nunfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\njob_operation_index:[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\njob_last_operation_end_times:[21, 52, 31, 0, 0, 0, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nmachine_operation_index:[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nmachine_last_operation_end_times:[93, 21, 31, 52, 0]\nfinished_operation_num:4\ncurrent_makespan:93\nnum_finished_jobs:0\nnum_unfinished_jobs:15\naverage_job_completion:13.133333333333333\nmax_job_completion_time:93\nmin_job_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_job_completion_time:26.03553127725434\naverage_machine_completion:39.4\nmax_machine_completion_time:93\nmin_machine_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_machine_completion_time:31.601265797432863\naverage_idle_time_per_machine:53.6\nproportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0\nproportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: least_work_remaining_66c9(job_priority).

Given that the job_priority heuristic has been applied with limited impact, it may be beneficial to switch to the local_search category. Local search techniques, such as _2opt_f9c1 or shift_operator_109f, can explore nearby solutions and potentially optimize the current schedule by addressing inefficiencies. This approach could lead to improvements in makespan and better machine utilization by refining the existing solution.\n***"
