I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which is a class of problems that involve finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve combinatorial optimization problems like JSSP due to their ability to find good solutions within a reasonable time frame, especially when exact methods are computationally expensive. Your framework of solutions and operators is aligned with typical approaches in solving such problems using heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves considering the characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem they are designed to address. Hereâs a breakdown:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) - `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful in environments where minimizing the makespan is crucial, and jobs with shorter operations should be prioritized to clear machine queues quickly.
   - **Quantification**: Best quantified by improvements in average flow time and reduced makespan for jobs with a wide range of operation times.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - `first_come_first_served_af26()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for environments where fairness or order of arrival is important, and jobs are processed in the order they arrive.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with uniform job sizes or when job priorities are equal, measured by average waiting time and machine idle time.

3. **Most Work Remaining - `most_work_remaining_df20()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful when it's important to address jobs with the most remaining work to prevent bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Best for environments where some jobs have significantly more operations than others, quantified by the reduction in job tardiness and improved throughput.

4. **Shift Operator - `shift_operator_109f()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective for fine-tuning schedules by shifting operations to optimize machine usage.
   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where small adjustments can lead to significant improvements in makespan or machine utilization.

5. **3-opt Heuristic - `_3opt_6ee0()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for optimizing complex schedules by rearranging operations to minimize total time.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in dense scheduling environments where multiple swaps can lead to a better sequence, measured by significant reductions in makespan.

6. **Longest Job Next - `longest_job_next_2e23()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Prioritizes jobs with the longest total processing time, useful when long jobs can create bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Best when there is a large variance in job lengths, quantified by improvement in the flow time of shorter jobs.

7. **2-opt Heuristic - `_2opt_f9c1()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for iterative improvement of a given schedule, especially in reducing makespan by swapping operations.
   - **Quantification**: Most effective in schedules that allow for flexibility in operation order, measured by reductions in makespan and total operation time.

8. **Random Selection - `random_6512()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful as a baseline or in stochastic environments where randomness can prevent local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Applied in highly dynamic or uncertain scheduling environments, measured by average performance over multiple runs.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) - `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Focuses on scheduling longer operations first to balance machine loads.
   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios with a mix of long and short operations, measured by balanced machine load and reduced idle times.

10. **Least Work Remaining - `least_work_remaining_66c9()`**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for quickly completing jobs with minimal remaining work to free up resources.
    - **Quantification**: Effective in environments where quick job turnover is advantageous, measured by the number of jobs completed per unit time.

11. **Shortest Job Next - `shortest_job_next_5b42()`**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Prioritizes jobs with the shortest processing time, effective for minimizing system time and improving responsiveness.
    - **Quantification**: Best when job sizes vary significantly and quick turnaround is needed, measured by reduced average job completion time.

These heuristics are designed for different aspects of the JSSP, and their effectiveness can be quantified by improvements in specific metrics like makespan, flow time, machine utilization, and job tardiness, depending on the scenario they are applied to.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_job_next_5b42. How does shortest_job_next_5b42 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the data and the summary of previous rounds, it appears that the heuristic `shortest_job_next_5b42` has been effective in reducing the makespan and completing jobs, especially towards the end of the problem-solving process. However, in the last round, it did not contribute to any further reduction in the makespan or completion of additional jobs. This might suggest that the heuristic has reached its potential or that the current schedule has limited opportunities for improvement through this approach.

Considering that the `shortest_job_next_5b42` heuristic focuses on the shortest remaining jobs, and given that all jobs are completed, it may be more beneficial to consider a different heuristic that can further optimize the current makespan by addressing potential inefficiencies in the schedule.

Based on the state data and the performance in previous rounds, I recommend trying a heuristic that focuses on optimizing the current sequence by adjusting the order of operations within machines. This could potentially further reduce the makespan by minimizing idle times or gaps in the machine schedule.

Therefore, my recommendation is:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shift_operator_109f
running steps: 10
hype parameter(optional): 
explanation: The Shift Operator heuristic will attempt to optimize the current schedule by shifting operations within machine queues to minimize idle times and improve the overall makespan. Given its prior success in Round 5, it is a strategic choice to potentially unlock further improvements in this phase of the solution.
