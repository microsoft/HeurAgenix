I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal sequence for a series of operations across multiple machines, which is a classic example of combinatorial optimization due to the discrete nature of the scheduling and sequencing choices. The use of heuristics is a common approach to solve such problems because they can provide good solutions within reasonable time frames, especially for complex and large-scale instances where exact methods might be computationally infeasible.

Your framework involving a `Solution` class and various operators such as `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, and `ShiftOperator` appears to be a structured approach to apply heuristic methods to this problem. The standardized heuristic function signature you provided is a suitable way to integrate different heuristic strategies into your framework.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves understanding the characteristics of each approach and the specific challenges they address within the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). Here's an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios where they might be best applied:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) d471**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when operations have varying processing times and quick job turnover is desired. It minimizes waiting times for machines by scheduling the shortest tasks first, potentially reducing idle time.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios where machine availability is a constraint and jobs have significantly different processing times.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) af26**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized. It schedules jobs in the order they arrive, which can be beneficial in systems with relatively balanced loads and where predictability is more important than optimization.
   - **Quantification**: Best for datasets where job arrival times significantly influence the scheduling order or when minimizing latency from job arrival to start is critical.

3. **Most Work Remaining df20**:
   - **Scenario**: This approach is effective in situations where minimizing the total remaining workload is crucial. It helps in balancing the load across machines by focusing on jobs with significant workloads left.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for scenarios with high variance in job workload and when it's important to ensure that large jobs are not left until the end.

4. **Shift Operator 109f**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where there might be local improvements available by shifting operations within the machine's queue. It can be particularly effective when the initial schedule is close to optimal.
   - **Quantification**: Best for scenarios where minor adjustments can lead to significant improvements in makespan.

5. **3-opt 6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in complex schedules where reordering operations can lead to substantial reductions in makespan. It focuses on improving sequences through a series of swaps, making it suitable for dense, interdependent job schedules.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in highly complex scheduling environments where local optimizations through swaps can cascade into broader improvements.

6. **Longest Job Next 2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the longest remaining processing time, which can be advantageous in preventing bottlenecks and ensuring that long jobs are completed in a timely manner.
   - **Quantification**: Best for scenarios where long jobs could otherwise dominate the end of the scheduling period, leading to inefficient use of resources.

7. **2-opt f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Similar to 3-opt but less complex, this heuristic is suitable for moderately complex schedules where simple swaps can lead to improved efficiency. It's a less computationally intensive option compared to 3-opt.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for scenarios with moderate complexity where a full 3-opt approach might be overkill.

8. **Random 6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Provides a stochastic approach that can be useful in exploratory phases or when combined with other heuristics to escape local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Best for early-stage exploration or in hybrid models where randomness aids in finding diverse solutions.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) 9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when balancing load across machines is crucial and when jobs with longer processing times should be prioritized to avoid bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in environments where the distribution of job lengths is skewed towards longer jobs.

10. **Least Work Remaining 66c9**:
    - **Scenario**: Focuses on quickly completing jobs with minimal work left, which can help in freeing up resources for more complex tasks.
    - **Quantification**: Suitable for scenarios where quickly reducing the number of active jobs is beneficial.

11. **Shortest Job Next 5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the shortest remaining processing time, which can be beneficial for minimizing the average time jobs spend in the system.
    - **Quantification**: Best for scenarios where throughput and job completion speed are prioritized.

Each heuristic has strengths and potential weaknesses, and their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, such as the distribution of job lengths, machine availability, and the overall complexity of the scheduling environment.

- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?

2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the data provided and the performance of the "shortest_job_next_5b42" heuristic in previous rounds, here is the analysis for the next steps:

The "shortest_job_next_5b42" heuristic has been effective in reducing the number of unfinished jobs and improving machine utilization. The delta in makespan and the increase in the number of finished jobs suggest that it is performing well in completing jobs with the least remaining processing time. Given this positive trend, it seems reasonable to continue using this heuristic for a few more steps to see if it continues to yield improvements.

1. The current data shows that there are still unfinished jobs, indicating that the solution can be further refined.
2. The recent use of "shortest_job_next_5b42" has resulted in substantial reductions in makespan and increases in finished jobs, suggesting continued potential for improvement.

Based on this, I recommend continuing with "shortest_job_next_5b42" for additional steps.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
running steps: 5
explanation: Continue using "shortest_job_next_5b42" to further reduce unfinished jobs and improve makespan, given its recent success in enhancing job completion and machine utilization.
