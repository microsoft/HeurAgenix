in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\n\nlocal_optimization: these heuristics focus on local improvements by attempting swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan or improve scheduling efficiency.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a strategic guide for each phase:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution quickly.\n2. **Heuristic Category Selection:**\n   - **Priority-Based Heuristics:** These heuristics are well-suited for constructing an initial solution because they allow you to quickly prioritize and schedule jobs based on predefined criteria.\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Begin with a heuristic such as `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to establish a baseline schedule.\n   - Evaluate the constructed solution's makespan and machine utilization.\n   - If the initial schedule is unsatisfactory, switch to another priority-based heuristic like `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` or `least_work_remaining_66c9` to explore different prioritization strategies.\n   - Limit the time spent on construction to quickly transition to the improvement phase.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Objective:** Optimize the initial solution by reducing the makespan or improving efficiency.\n2. **Heuristic Category Selection:**\n   - **Local Optimization Heuristics:** Focus on refining the existing schedule through small, local changes to improve the solution quality.\n   - **Exploratory Heuristics:** Use these to escape local optima and introduce diversity in the search process.\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Start with local optimization techniques like `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to perform swaps that may lead to a better solution.\n   - Periodically apply the `random_6512` exploratory heuristic to introduce randomness and prevent the solution from stagnating in a local optimum.\n   - Use `shift_operator_109f` strategically to fine-tune the sequence of operations within machine queues.\n   - Iterate between local optimization and exploratory heuristics to balance exploitation and exploration.\n   - Continuously monitor performance metrics like makespan, machine idle time, and overall utilization to guide the selection of heuristics.\n\n### Iterative Strategy\n\n- **Flexibility:** Be prepared to switch heuristics based on performance feedback. If a particular heuristic is not yielding improvements, try another one from the same category or a different category.\n- **Diversity:** Alternate between different heuristic categories to explore various aspects of the solution space.\n- **Evaluation:** After each iteration or phase, evaluate the solution quality and adjust the heuristic selection strategy accordingly.\n\n### General Guidelines\n\n- **Avoid Overfitting:** Don\u2019t rely too heavily on a single heuristic or category; this could lead to overfitting to specific problem instances.\n- **Balance Exploration and Exploitation:** Maintain a balance between exploring new solutions and exploiting known good solutions to ensure a robust search process.\n- **Experimentation:** Use the iterative nature of the process to experiment with different heuristic combinations and discover effective strategies.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically approach the JSSP, leveraging the strengths of various heuristics to construct and improve solutions effectively."

Priority-based heuristics are well-suited for constructing an initial schedule efficiently. Starting with a priority-based approach will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of various prioritization strategies, such as first-come-first-served or shortest-processing-time-first, and create a baseline solution for further optimization.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->72\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since we've just begun constructing the initial solution with only one operation scheduled and no jobs completed, it's beneficial to continue using a priority-based heuristic. This approach will help establish a more comprehensive initial schedule, allowing us to better evaluate the effectiveness of prioritization strategies. Continuing with priority-based heuristics can help ensure that we efficiently schedule the remaining operations across machines, setting a solid foundation for future improvements.

This approach will help further develop the initial solution by efficiently scheduling the remaining operations. Priority-based heuristics can help ensure that operations are allocated to machines in a manner that balances workload and machine availability, establishing a more solid foundation for future optimization.

This will help refine the existing partial solution by making small, targeted improvements that can reduce the makespan and improve scheduling efficiency. By focusing on local optimization, we can explore potential improvements in the current sequence of operations, such as swaps or shifts, which may lead to a more effective allocation of operations across machines.
