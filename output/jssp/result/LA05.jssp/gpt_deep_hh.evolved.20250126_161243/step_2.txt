I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making a sequence of decisions to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing the makespan, which fits the definition of combinatorial optimization. Heuristics are commonly used to solve JSSP because the problem is NP-hard, meaning that exact solutions are computationally expensive for larger instances. The framework you've described, with its focus on solutions and operators, is a suitable approach for applying heuristic algorithms to tackle JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,exploratory

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as operation time, total processing time remaining, or other state-based metrics.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

local_optimization: these heuristics focus on local improvements by attempting swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan or improve scheduling efficiency.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

exploratory: this heuristic explores the solution space randomly and is less powerful than structured approaches.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [4, 3, 0, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2, 0, 4], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 0, 4, 1, 2], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0, 4], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[72, 87, 95, 66, 60], [5, 35, 48, 39, 54], [46, 20, 21, 97, 55], [59, 19, 46, 34, 37], [23, 73, 25, 24, 28], [28, 45, 5, 78, 83], [53, 71, 37, 29, 12], [12, 87, 33, 55, 38], [49, 83, 40, 48, 7], [65, 17, 90, 27, 23]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:45.66
max_operation_time:97
min_operation_time:5
std_deviation_operation_time:25.13850433100585
job_operation_time_range:92
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To create a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), it's important to consider the different phases of the problem-solving process: the construction phase and the improvement phase. The aim is to build an initial feasible solution and then iteratively improve it. Here's a strategic guide for each phase:

### Construction Phase

1. **Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution quickly.
2. **Heuristic Category Selection:**
   - **Priority-Based Heuristics:** These heuristics are well-suited for constructing an initial solution because they allow you to quickly prioritize and schedule jobs based on predefined criteria.
3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Begin with a heuristic such as `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to establish a baseline schedule.
   - Evaluate the constructed solution's makespan and machine utilization.
   - If the initial schedule is unsatisfactory, switch to another priority-based heuristic like `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` or `least_work_remaining_66c9` to explore different prioritization strategies.
   - Limit the time spent on construction to quickly transition to the improvement phase.

### Improvement Phase

1. **Objective:** Optimize the initial solution by reducing the makespan or improving efficiency.
2. **Heuristic Category Selection:**
   - **Local Optimization Heuristics:** Focus on refining the existing schedule through small, local changes to improve the solution quality.
   - **Exploratory Heuristics:** Use these to escape local optima and introduce diversity in the search process.
3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Start with local optimization techniques like `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to perform swaps that may lead to a better solution.
   - Periodically apply the `random_6512` exploratory heuristic to introduce randomness and prevent the solution from stagnating in a local optimum.
   - Use `shift_operator_109f` strategically to fine-tune the sequence of operations within machine queues.
   - Iterate between local optimization and exploratory heuristics to balance exploitation and exploration.
   - Continuously monitor performance metrics like makespan, machine idle time, and overall utilization to guide the selection of heuristics.

### Iterative Strategy

- **Flexibility:** Be prepared to switch heuristics based on performance feedback. If a particular heuristic is not yielding improvements, try another one from the same category or a different category.
- **Diversity:** Alternate between different heuristic categories to explore various aspects of the solution space.
- **Evaluation:** After each iteration or phase, evaluate the solution quality and adjust the heuristic selection strategy accordingly.

### General Guidelines

- **Avoid Overfitting:** Donât rely too heavily on a single heuristic or category; this could lead to overfitting to specific problem instances.
- **Balance Exploration and Exploitation:** Maintain a balance between exploring new solutions and exploiting known good solutions to ensure a robust search process.
- **Experimentation:** Use the iterative nature of the process to experiment with different heuristic combinations and discover effective strategies.

By following this strategic guide, you can systematically approach the JSSP, leveraging the strengths of various heuristics to construct and improve solutions effectively.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [4, 3, 0, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2, 0, 4], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 0, 4, 1, 2], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0, 4], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[72, 87, 95, 66, 60], [5, 35, 48, 39, 54], [46, 20, 21, 97, 55], [59, 19, 46, 34, 37], [23, 73, 25, 24, 28], [28, 45, 5, 78, 83], [53, 71, 37, 29, 12], [12, 87, 33, 55, 38], [49, 83, 40, 48, 7], [65, 17, 90, 27, 23]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:45.66
max_operation_time:97
min_operation_time:5
std_deviation_operation_time:25.13850433100585
job_operation_time_range:92
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since no operations have been scheduled yet and all jobs are unfinished, it's important to quickly establish an initial feasible solution. Priority-based heuristics are well-suited for constructing an initial schedule efficiently. Starting with a priority-based approach will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of various prioritization strategies, such as first-come-first-served or shortest-processing-time-first, and create a baseline solution for further optimization.
current_makespan: 0->72
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Since we've just begun constructing the initial solution with only one operation scheduled and no jobs completed, it's beneficial to continue using a priority-based heuristic. This approach will help establish a more comprehensive initial schedule, allowing us to better evaluate the effectiveness of prioritization strategies. Continuing with priority-based heuristics can help ensure that we efficiently schedule the remaining operations across machines, setting a solid foundation for future improvements. Once a more complete initial solution is formed, we can then transition to local optimization or exploratory heuristics to refine the solution further.
current_makespan: 72->72
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:
current_solution:
machine_0: 
machine_1: 0
machine_2: 
machine_3: 
machine_4: 1

finished_jobs:[]
unfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
job_operation_index:[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
job_last_operation_end_times:[72, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
machine_operation_index:[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
machine_last_operation_end_times:[0, 72, 0, 0, 5]
finished_operation_num:2
current_makespan:72
num_finished_jobs:0
num_unfinished_jobs:10
average_job_completion:7.7
max_job_completion_time:72
min_job_completion_time:0
std_dev_job_completion_time:21.485111123752652
average_machine_completion:15.4
max_machine_completion_time:72
min_machine_completion_time:0
std_dev_machine_completion_time:28.366177042386234
average_idle_time_per_machine:56.6
proportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0
proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: shortest_job_next_5b42(priority_based). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,exploratory

The response format is very important.
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(priority_based,local_optimization,exploratory)
explanation:xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:priority_based
explanation: Since the current solution is still in the early stages of development with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed, it is advisable to continue using a priority-based heuristic. This approach will help further develop the initial solution by efficiently scheduling the remaining operations. Priority-based heuristics can help ensure that operations are allocated to machines in a manner that balances workload and machine availability, establishing a more solid foundation for future optimization. Once the initial solution is more developed, transitioning to local optimization or exploratory heuristics can be considered for further refinement.
