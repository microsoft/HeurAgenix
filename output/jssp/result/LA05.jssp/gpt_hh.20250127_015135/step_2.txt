I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves finding an optimal ordering and assignment of jobs to machines to minimize makespan or other objectives. It can be effectively tackled using heuristic and hyper-heuristic approaches, given its complex solution space and constraints. The framework you've described, including the Solution and Operator classes, as well as the heuristic function signature, aligns well with typical approaches for solving combinatorial optimization problems like JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves understanding the characteristics of the problem instances that align with the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic. Here’s an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios they are best suited for:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: When the initial solution has suboptimal sequences within machines, and there is potential for improvement by reordering tasks. This heuristic is useful in situations where small local changes can lead to significant improvements in the overall schedule.
   - **Quantified by**: High initial makespan with apparent gaps or idle times in machine schedules.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**: 
   - **Scenario**: When the goal is to minimize the average completion time of jobs and the distribution of processing times is varied. This heuristic performs well when shorter tasks can be completed quickly, allowing more jobs to progress simultaneously.
   - **Quantified by**: Wide range of operation times with several short operations relative to others.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**: 
   - **Scenario**: When there is a complex interdependency between tasks and the solution space is large, making local changes insufficient. This heuristic is suitable for exploration of multiple swap possibilities in search of a more optimal sequence.
   - **Quantified by**: High complexity in job dependencies and large potential for sequence improvements.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**: 
   - **Scenario**: When minimizing the makespan is critical, and there are significant differences in job lengths. Prioritizing longer jobs can prevent them from becoming bottlenecks later in the schedule.
   - **Quantified by**: Large variance in total processing times across jobs.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**: 
   - **Scenario**: Similar to the 3-opt, but for less complex problems where two-swap operations can effectively explore the solution space. Applicable when small improvements can lead to better solutions.
   - **Quantified by**: Moderate complexity with potential for local optimization through swaps.

6. **random_6512**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful in early stages of exploration or when combined with other heuristics to escape local optima. The random approach can be beneficial when deterministic methods fail to provide improvements.
   - **Quantified by**: Stagnation in other heuristic performances or the need for diverse solutions.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**: 
   - **Scenario**: When it is critical to ensure that the most complex and time-consuming jobs are prioritized to avoid future delays.
   - **Quantified by**: Jobs with significantly higher total remaining processing times.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**: 
   - **Scenario**: When aiming to balance the load on machines by scheduling longer tasks first to maximize utilization.
   - **Quantified by**: Operations with long processing times relative to others.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**: 
   - **Scenario**: When there is a need to quickly complete as many jobs as possible, potentially freeing up resources for remaining tasks.
   - **Quantified by**: Jobs with minimal remaining work compared to others.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**: 
    - **Scenario**: Similar to the shortest processing time heuristic, best when the focus is on quickly reducing the number of pending jobs.
    - **Quantified by**: Jobs with small total remaining processing times.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**: 
    - **Scenario**: When jobs arrive dynamically, and fairness or simplicity is prioritized. It’s suitable for environments where job arrival time is critical.
    - **Quantified by**: Jobs arriving at different times with little variation in processing times.

By understanding these scenarios, you can better match heuristics to specific problem instances, potentially improving solution quality and computational efficiency.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given that all jobs are currently unfinished and the operation times have a wide range with a low average, using the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic will help in quickly advancing operations with shorter durations. This approach can effectively reduce the makespan by ensuring that shorter tasks are completed sooner, allowing more operations to progress simultaneously.
Delta of current_makespan: 104
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows that all jobs are still unfinished with a high makespan. The Shortest Processing Time First heuristic has already been applied but given its potential to quickly advance operations with shorter durations, it is worth continuing for a few more steps. This strategy aims to further reduce the makespan by allowing more operations to complete and potentially reveal new scheduling opportunities. Additionally, since the jobs have diverse operation times, focusing on shorter tasks could still effectively improve the overall schedule.
Delta of current_makespan: 265
Delta of Finished Job Num: 2
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Given the current state data and the results from the previous rounds, we can analyze whether to continue with the same heuristic or switch to a different one.

### Current Analysis:
- **Current Makespan**: 369, which indicates room for improvement given the initial makespan reduction.
- **Finished Jobs**: 2 out of 10, showing that most jobs remain unfinished.
- **Proportion of Unfinished Jobs**: 0.8, which suggests a significant number of jobs still need scheduling.
- **Idle Time per Machine**: 72.2, indicating potential inefficiencies in machine utilization.

### Performance of `shortest_processing_time_first_c374`:
- This heuristic has shown some reduction in makespan and has completed 2 jobs in the last 20 steps.
- It focuses on advancing operations with shorter durations, which can be effective given the wide range of operation times.

### Considerations for Next Steps:
- The substantial number of unfinished jobs and the high current makespan suggest further optimization is required.
- Given the previous effectiveness of reducing makespan and completing jobs, continuing with the same heuristic may yield additional benefits, especially if short operations are still prevalent.

### Decision:
Based on the analysis, it seems prudent to continue with the `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic for additional steps to further reduce makespan and increase job completion.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
running steps: 10
explanation: Continuing with the shortest processing time heuristic as it has shown effectiveness in reducing makespan and advancing job completion. The focus remains on leveraging the diversity of operation times to improve machine utilization and decrease idle times.
