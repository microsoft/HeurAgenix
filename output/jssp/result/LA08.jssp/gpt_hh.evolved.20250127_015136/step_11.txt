I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively approached using heuristics. The framework you described, including the Solution and Operator classes, as well as the standardized heuristic function signature, is consistent with methodologies used to tackle such problems. The operators you have implemented (AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, ReverseSequenceOperator, and ShiftOperator) are common techniques used in heuristic algorithms to explore the solution space for combinatorial problems like JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To determine the applicability of each heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we need to consider the characteristics and constraints of the problem at hand. Here is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic might be most effective:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) - `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`**: 
   - **Scenario**: When jobs have significantly varying processing times for their operations.
   - **Quantified by**: High variance in operation processing times across jobs.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - `first_come_first_served_af26`**:
   - **Scenario**: When jobs arrive in a specific order and need to be processed without much delay.
   - **Quantified by**: The arrival time or order of jobs is crucial, and the focus is on fairness.

3. **Most Work Remaining (MWR) - `most_work_remaining_df20`**:
   - **Scenario**: When the objective is to complete jobs with the highest remaining workload early to balance machine usage.
   - **Quantified by**: The sum of processing times of remaining operations for each job.

4. **Shift Operator - `shift_operator_109f`**:
   - **Scenario**: When minor adjustments within machine queues can lead to significant improvements in makespan.
   - **Quantified by**: The presence of operations that can be moved without disrupting the sequence constraint.

5. **3-opt Heuristic - `_3opt_6ee0`**:
   - **Scenario**: When the solution needs significant reordering to reduce makespan, especially in complex job sequences.
   - **Quantified by**: High initial makespan with non-optimal job sequences.

6. **Longest Job Next - `longest_job_next_2e23`**:
   - **Scenario**: When prioritizing longer jobs could help in reducing bottlenecks or balancing machine load.
   - **Quantified by**: The total processing time of jobs, emphasizing those with long durations.

7. **2-opt Heuristic - `_2opt_f9c1`**:
   - **Scenario**: When specific pairwise swaps can optimize the schedule without breaking job sequence constraints.
   - **Quantified by**: High initial makespan with the potential for localized improvements.

8. **Random Selection - `random_6512`**:
   - **Scenario**: When exploring diverse solutions to avoid local optima, especially in early stages of search.
   - **Quantified by**: The need for solution diversity and exploration.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) - `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**:
   - **Scenario**: When the focus is on scheduling longer operations first to ensure that longer tasks are not left to the end.
   - **Quantified by**: Operations with high processing times across jobs.

10. **Least Work Remaining (LWR) - `least_work_remaining_66c9`**:
    - **Scenario**: When the goal is to quickly complete jobs with less remaining work, potentially freeing up resources.
    - **Quantified by**: The sum of processing times of remaining operations for each job, focusing on minimal sums.

11. **Shortest Job Next - `shortest_job_next_5b42`**:
    - **Scenario**: When quick wins are important, and jobs with shorter remaining times can be completed to reduce complexity.
    - **Quantified by**: The total processing time of remaining operations, favoring shorter jobs.

These scenarios help in selecting the appropriate heuristic based on the specific characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem instance being tackled.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _3opt_6ee0. How does _3opt_6ee0 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the data and summaries provided, here is the analysis for the next steps:

The current approach with the `_3opt_6ee0` heuristic has not shown improvements in the recent rounds. Given the diminishing returns from this heuristic and the previous successful application of the `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` heuristic, it might be beneficial to revisit this approach or try a new one to optimize the makespan and improve job completion rates.

Considering the high variance in operation times and the current state of unfinished jobs, revisiting `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` or even trying `most_work_remaining_df20` could help in addressing the remaining bottlenecks and balancing machine utilization. The choice should also consider the high standard deviation in job completion times, suggesting that focusing on jobs with significant remaining work might yield benefits.

Therefore, I recommend switching to `most_work_remaining_df20` for a fresh perspective on handling the workload distribution.

Here is the proposed action:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
running steps: 10
explanation: Given the current state with a high standard deviation in job completion times and unfinished jobs, the Most Work Remaining heuristic can help address workload imbalances and optimize the schedule by focusing on jobs with significant remaining operations. This approach aims to improve makespan and balance machine utilization more effectively than the current strategy.
