I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id

        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal sequence of jobs on machines, which is a classic example of a problem that can be addressed using heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms. The framework you've described with the `Solution` class and various `Operator` classes provides a structured approach to applying heuristics to solve the JSSP. The use of operators to manipulate solutions is a common strategy in hyper-heuristics for combinatorial problems, allowing for the exploration of the solution space through different heuristic moves. Your framework and the heuristic function signature seem appropriate for tackling JSSP as a combinatorial operation problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic could be most applicable involves understanding the nature of the heuristic and the characteristics of the problem instances where they might perform well. Here is a breakdown of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful when small local adjustments can significantly reduce the makespan. Applicable in schedules that are already near-optimal but might benefit from minor reordering of tasks within machines.
   - **Quantification**: Large makespan reduction from small changes, typically when the current schedule is dense with few gaps.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for scenarios where shorter operations can be scheduled to keep machines busy, minimizing idle time.
   - **Quantification**: High number of short operations relative to long ones, and when machine idle time is a significant issue.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when a more global restructuring is needed, especially in cases with complex interdependencies between operations.
   - **Quantification**: Situations where local optima are frequent and a broader search is needed to escape them.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in balancing the schedule by starting with jobs that have the longest total processing time, preventing them from being bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Jobs with significantly varying total processing times, where the longest jobs might otherwise dominate the schedule if not prioritized.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for schedules where non-adjacent operations can be swapped to achieve a better sequence and reduce makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Instances where operations are not tightly coupled, allowing beneficial swaps without violating constraints.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for escaping local optima by introducing randomness, providing diverse solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in large, complex problem instances where deterministic heuristics consistently reach suboptimal solutions.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the most remaining work, reducing the likelihood of long jobs becoming future bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: High variance in job lengths and when jobs with large remaining workloads are at risk of prolonging the schedule.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when longer operations are critical and should be prioritized to avoid delays.
   - **Quantification**: High variance in operation lengths where longer operations could significantly impact the makespan.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for quickly clearing shorter jobs, potentially reducing the makespan by freeing up resources sooner.
   - **Quantification**: Situations with many short jobs that can be completed quickly, providing immediate resource availability benefits.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Similar to least work remaining but focuses on the shortest total job time, useful in high-turnover environments.
    - **Quantification**: High job count with significant variation in job lengths, aiming to minimize the waiting time for shorter jobs.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Scenario**: Appropriate in environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized, or when job arrival times are critical.
    - **Quantification**: Jobs with significant arrival time differences and when maintaining order of arrival is necessary or beneficial.

By understanding these scenarios, you can better match each heuristic to problem instances where they might be most effective, improving overall scheduling outcomes.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx

assistant
Based on the current state data and the performance summary from previous rounds, the heuristic "shortest_processing_time_first_c374" has demonstrated consistent effectiveness in reducing the makespan and increasing the number of finished operations. However, the improvements have been relatively incremental, and there is a risk of diminishing returns if we continue to rely solely on this heuristic.

Given the high makespan and the presence of unfinished jobs, it would be prudent to continue with "shortest_processing_time_first_c374" for a few more steps to further optimize the schedule. Simultaneously, it is essential to monitor the performance closely to decide if a switch to another heuristic is warranted in subsequent iterations.

Therefore, I recommend continuing with the current heuristic for 3 more steps, as this will allow us to leverage its strengths while keeping an eye on any potential plateau in improvements.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
