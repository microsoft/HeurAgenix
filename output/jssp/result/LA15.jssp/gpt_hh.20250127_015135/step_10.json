In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

It has been effective in reducing idle times and advancing job completion. However, the incremental improvements suggest that we might be approaching a point of diminishing returns. \n\nConsidering the data:\n- The `current_makespan` has not been significantly reduced in the last few rounds.\n- The `proportion_of_finished_jobs` is still relatively low at 0.3, indicating room for improvement.\n\nI suggest continuing with `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` for a few more steps to see if we can achieve further reductions in the makespan and increase the number of finished jobs. We should monitor the improvements closely and be ready to switch heuristics if the improvements stall.\n\nHere is the recommended action:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nrunning steps: 5\nexplanation: Continuing with shortest_processing_time_first_c374 as it has shown effectiveness in previous rounds. Running a few more steps could potentially further reduce the makespan and increase the number of finished jobs. We will assess the improvements closely and consider switching heuristics if necessary.\n***"
