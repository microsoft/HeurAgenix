I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal scheduling sequence for jobs across machines, which is a classic example of combinatorial optimization due to the discrete nature of the scheduling decisions and the large number of possible combinations. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve JSSP because of the problem's NP-hardness, where exact methods become computationally infeasible for large instances. Your framework, which includes a Solution and Operator design, aligns well with the typical approach for tackling such problems using heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios for each heuristic involves understanding the characteristics of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) instance where the heuristic might perform well. Here's a breakdown of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable when there is flexibility in rearranging operations within machine queues without violating precedence constraints. It can be effective in situations where there are bottlenecks in specific machines that can be alleviated by small adjustments in the operation order.
   - **Quantified by**: High variability in operation times within a machine, presence of local bottlenecks.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when minimizing idle time for machines is crucial, and there is a wide range of processing times across operations. It's effective when shorter operations can be completed quickly, freeing up machines for longer tasks.
   - **Quantified by**: Significant variation in operation processing times, high machine idle time.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: The 3-opt heuristic, approximated by 2-opt in JSSP, is effective when there is a need to explore significant rearrangements in the schedule to break out of local optima.
   - **Quantified by**: Large search space, presence of multiple local optima.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when longer jobs are likely to cause delays if not prioritized, perhaps due to tight deadlines or high penalties for late completion.
   - **Quantified by**: High variance in job lengths, strict deadlines for long jobs.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for instances where swapping two operations can significantly improve the schedule, particularly in dense schedules where small changes can lead to large improvements.
   - **Quantified by**: Dense operation sequences with potential for improvement through swaps.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful as a diversification strategy in metaheuristic frameworks or for initial solution generation where randomness can help escape local optima.
   - **Quantified by**: Need for diversification, exploration over exploitation.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when jobs with a lot of remaining work could become critical path activities if not prioritized, potentially delaying the entire schedule.
   - **Quantified by**: High variance in remaining work, critical path analysis indicating potential delays.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in scenarios where longer operations, if delayed, can lead to machine idleness or delays in subsequent operations.
   - **Quantified by**: High variance in operation times, machine utilization rates.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when completing jobs quickly can reduce complexity or when early completion bonuses are available.
   - **Quantified by**: Small jobs dominating the schedule, early completion incentives.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Suitable when quickly clearing shorter jobs can reduce system complexity and free up resources for longer tasks.
    - **Quantified by**: Presence of many short jobs, need to reduce queue lengths.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Scenario**: Best for scenarios where fairness or simplicity is prioritized, and all jobs have similar characteristics.
    - **Quantified by**: Uniform job characteristics, low variance in processing times.

Understanding the specific characteristics of your JSSP instance and matching them with these scenarios can help select the most appropriate heuristic or combination of heuristics to optimize the scheduling process.
