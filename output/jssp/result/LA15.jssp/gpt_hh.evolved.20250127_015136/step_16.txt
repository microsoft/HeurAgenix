I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which is a type of combinatorial operation problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations on machines to minimize the total processing time, also known as makespan, subject to various constraints. Heuristic algorithms are commonly used to solve such problems due to the complexity and size of the solution space. Your framework, which includes the Solution and Operator classes, appears to be correctly structured for implementing heuristic algorithms for JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is applicable involves understanding the characteristics of the problem instances and how these characteristics align with the strengths of each heuristic. Hereâs a breakdown of the scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) with Dynamic Scoring (d471):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** 
     - Instances where minimizing individual operation times can significantly reduce overall makespan.
     - Suitable for environments where quick completion of shorter tasks can free up resources for longer tasks.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) Enhanced (af26):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Ideal for systems where fairness or simplicity in scheduling is prioritized.
     - Useful in scenarios with high variability in operation arrival times, where immediate impact and adaptation are critical.

3. **Most Work Remaining with Dynamic Scoring (df20):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Effective in instances where balancing the workload across jobs is essential.
     - Suitable for projects where longer jobs need to be prioritized to avoid bottlenecks.

4. **Shift Operator (109f):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Useful when small local adjustments can lead to significant improvements in makespan.
     - Ideal for fine-tuning schedules where the initial setup is near-optimal.

5. **3-opt Heuristic (6ee0):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Effective in dense and complex schedules where multiple swaps can lead to improvements.
     - Suitable for problems requiring intensive local search to escape local optima.

6. **Longest Job Next (2e23):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Useful when longer jobs are critical and need prioritization to avoid future delays.
     - Effective in systems where completing longer jobs early can minimize waiting times for subsequent jobs.

7. **2-opt Heuristic (f9c1):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Ideal for optimizing sequences in moderately complex schedules.
     - Useful when minor rearrangements of operations can significantly reduce the makespan.

8. **Random Heuristic (6512):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Suitable for exploration in large solution spaces where deterministic methods might get stuck.
     - Effective as a baseline or control heuristic in comparative studies.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) (9dc9):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - Effective in environments where longer operations can be initiated early to balance workload over time.
     - Suitable for systems where resource availability is a constraint for longer tasks.

10. **Least Work Remaining (66c9):**
    - **Applicable Scenarios:**
      - Useful when the focus is on completing smaller jobs quickly to reduce queue length.
      - Effective in environments where quick wins can lead to more efficient resource utilization.

11. **Shortest Job Next (5b42):**
    - **Applicable Scenarios:**
      - Ideal for systems where quick turnover and reduced waiting times for short jobs are prioritized.
      - Suitable for balancing workloads by completing shorter jobs earlier.

Quantifying these scenarios involves considering factors such as job arrival rates, processing times, resource availability, and system priorities. Data analysis and simulation can help in identifying which heuristic performs best under specific conditions.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9. How does longest_processing_time_first_9dc9 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
running steps: 5
explanation: The longest_processing_time_first_9dc9 heuristic has consistently shown improvements in reducing the makespan and increasing job completion across recent rounds. Given the ongoing progress and the current state of the problem, it is advisable to continue with this heuristic for an additional 5 steps. This continuation aims to further optimize the schedule by focusing on longer operations, potentially alleviating bottlenecks and creating more opportunities for shorter jobs. The strategy remains effective, and further application is expected to yield additional improvements towards an optimal solution.
