I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial operation problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations to be performed on a set of machines, which is a characteristic of combinatorial problems. The use of hyper-heuristics and operators to modify solutions aligns well with approaches used to tackle such problems. Your framework, which includes the Solution and various Operator classes, appears to be well-suited for addressing the JSSP using heuristic methods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): job_priority_based,processing_time_based,local_optimization,makespan_reduction

job_priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as remaining work, processing time, or job length.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

processing_time_based: these heuristics focus on selecting jobs based on their processing times, either maximizing or minimizing the time required for the next operation.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.

local_optimization: these heuristics involve local optimization techniques that attempt to improve the current solution by making small adjustments such as swaps or shifts.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

makespan_reduction: these heuristics are aimed at reducing the overall makespan by optimizing the sequence of operations.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

When tackling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) using hyper-heuristics, it's crucial to strategically alternate between different heuristic categories to construct and improve solutions iteratively. Here’s a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:

### Construction Phase

1. **Objective:** Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.
2. **Heuristic Categories:**
   - **Job Priority Based:** Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to prioritize jobs and get a sense of the job and machine interaction patterns.
   - **Processing Time Based:** Implement `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to minimize immediate operation processing times, setting a baseline for makespan.
3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Select a heuristic from the job priority-based category to establish an order of job processing.
   - Use processing time-based heuristics to schedule operations, focusing on minimizing processing time and balancing machine load.
   - Evaluate initial makespan and machine utilization to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

### Improvement Phase

1. **Objective:** Optimize the initial solution by reducing makespan and improving schedule efficiency.
2. **Heuristic Categories:**
   - **Local Optimization:** Employ `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f` to refine the current solution by making small, localized adjustments.
   - **Makespan Reduction:** Focus on `_3opt_6ee0` and `shift_operator_109f` to directly target and reduce makespan by reordering operations intelligently.
3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Apply local optimization heuristics to identify and rectify inefficiencies in job sequences on individual machines.
   - Use makespan reduction heuristics to iteratively adjust the sequence of operations across machines, aiming to reduce overall completion time.
   - Continuously monitor the effect of each heuristic on the makespan and machine utilization.
   - Alternate between local optimization and makespan reduction heuristics to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

### Iterative Strategy

- **Evaluation:** After each round of heuristic application, evaluate the solution's performance using metrics like makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.
- **Adjustment:** Based on the evaluation, decide whether to continue with the current heuristic category or switch to another. The goal is to balance exploration (trying new heuristics) and exploitation (refining current solutions).
- **Switching Heuristics:** If a particular heuristic fails to yield improvements, switch categories or try different heuristics within the same category. This helps in avoiding stagnation and promotes exploration of the solution space.

### Finalization Phase

1. **Objective:** Fine-tune the best solution found.
2. **Heuristic Categories:**
   - **Makespan Reduction:** Focus exclusively on refining the solution to minimize the makespan as much as possible.
3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Apply the most successful makespan reduction heuristic from previous phases to finalize the schedule.
   - Conduct a final evaluation to ensure the solution meets all constraints and optimization goals.

This strategic guide is designed to provide a flexible framework for selecting and applying heuristics in a systematic manner. By alternating between different heuristic categories and adapting based on performance, you can effectively explore and exploit the solution space to tackle the JSSP.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:

machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[0, 2, 1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1], [1, 4, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 1], [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], [0, 4, 1, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [0, 2, 1, 4, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [2, 0, 3, 1, 4], [0, 2, 1, 3, 4], [0, 3, 2, 1, 4], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [1, 4, 2, 0, 3], [3, 0, 2, 4, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3]]

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: job_priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since we are at the initial stage with no operations scheduled yet, starting with a job priority-based heuristic will help establish an initial feasible solution. This category allows us to prioritize jobs effectively and set the groundwork for subsequent optimization, providing a structured starting point for further development.
current_makespan: 0->6
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: processing_time_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current stage involves minimal progress with only one operation scheduled, and the makespan is still quite low. To enhance the existing solution and balance the workload across machines, switching to a processing_time_based heuristic could be beneficial. This category will help in minimizing operation times and effectively utilizing machine capacities, setting a stronger foundation for further optimization.
current_makespan: 6->95
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:

proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(processing_time_based). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: job_priority_based,processing_time_based,local_optimization,makespan_reduction

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:job_priority_based
explanation: Given the current state with minimal progress and an uneven distribution of operations across machines, switching back to a job priority-based heuristic can help prioritize operations effectively. This category is beneficial for establishing a more balanced and strategic approach to scheduling the remaining operations. By focusing on job priorities, we can aim to distribute the workload more evenly and potentially reduce the makespan, setting a more robust foundation for future optimization efforts.
