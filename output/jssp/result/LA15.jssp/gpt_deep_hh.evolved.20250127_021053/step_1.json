This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP.

Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\n\nprocessing_time_based: these heuristics focus on selecting jobs based on their processing times, either maximizing or minimizing the time required for the next operation.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP.

This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "When tackling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) using hyper-heuristics, it's crucial to strategically alternate between different heuristic categories to construct and improve solutions iteratively. Here\u2019s a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Objective:** Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.\n2. **Heuristic Categories:**\n   - **Job Priority Based:** Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to prioritize jobs and get a sense of the job and machine interaction patterns.\n   - **Processing Time Based:** Implement `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to minimize immediate operation processing times, setting a baseline for makespan.\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Select a heuristic from the job priority-based category to establish an order of job processing.\n   - Use processing time-based heuristics to schedule operations, focusing on minimizing processing time and balancing machine load.\n   - Evaluate initial makespan and machine utilization to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Objective:** Optimize the initial solution by reducing makespan and improving schedule efficiency.\n2. **Heuristic Categories:**\n   - **Local Optimization:** Employ `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f` to refine the current solution by making small, localized adjustments.\n   - **Makespan Reduction:** Focus on `_3opt_6ee0` and `shift_operator_109f` to directly target and reduce makespan by reordering operations intelligently.\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Apply local optimization heuristics to identify and rectify inefficiencies in job sequences on individual machines.\n   - Use makespan reduction heuristics to iteratively adjust the sequence of operations across machines, aiming to reduce overall completion time.\n   - Continuously monitor the effect of each heuristic on the makespan and machine utilization.\n   - Alternate between local optimization and makespan reduction heuristics to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\n### Iterative Strategy\n\n- **Evaluation:** After each round of heuristic application, evaluate the solution's performance using metrics like makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.\n- **Adjustment:** Based on the evaluation, decide whether to continue with the current heuristic category or switch to another. The goal is to balance exploration (trying new heuristics) and exploitation (refining current solutions).\n- **Switching Heuristics:** If a particular heuristic fails to yield improvements, switch categories or try different heuristics within the same category. This helps in avoiding stagnation and promotes exploration of the solution space.\n\n### Finalization Phase\n\n1. **Objective:** Fine-tune the best solution found.\n2. **Heuristic Categories:**\n   - **Makespan Reduction:** Focus exclusively on refining the solution to minimize the makespan as much as possible.\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Apply the most successful makespan reduction heuristic from previous phases to finalize the schedule.\n   - Conduct a final evaluation to ensure the solution meets all constraints and optimization goals.\n\nThis strategic guide is designed to provide a flexible framework for selecting and applying heuristics in a systematic manner. By alternating between different heuristic categories and adapting based on performance, you can effectively explore and exploit the solution space to tackle the JSSP."
