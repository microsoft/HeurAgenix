I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves making a sequence of decisions to determine the optimal schedule for jobs across machines, which inherently involves combinatorial decision-making. Heuristics are commonly used to find good solutions for JSSP due to the problem's complexity and the large search space. Your framework, including the Solution and Operator classes, as well as the heuristic function signature, seems well-suited for addressing this type of problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,dynamic_scoring,specialized_scenarios

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as processing times, remaining work, or job length to optimize scheduling.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_optimization: these heuristics focus on improving the current solution by making local changes like swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

dynamic_scoring: these heuristics utilize dynamic scoring mechanisms to adapt to the current state and prioritize jobs accordingly.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

specialized_scenarios: these heuristics are tailored for scenarios where specific job characteristics, such as job length or processing times, are the primary consideration.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[20, 87, 31, 76, 17], [25, 32, 24, 18, 81], [72, 23, 28, 58, 99], [86, 76, 97, 45, 90], [27, 42, 48, 17, 46], [67, 98, 48, 27, 62], [28, 12, 19, 80, 50], [63, 94, 98, 50, 80], [14, 75, 50, 41, 55], [72, 18, 37, 79, 61]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:52.86
max_operation_time:99
min_operation_time:12
std_deviation_operation_time:26.944394593310125
job_operation_time_range:87
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps is crucial for effectively solving the JSSP through an iterative process. Here's a suggested framework:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Construction
1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**
   - **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible initial solution by prioritizing jobs.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Start with a simple priority-based heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish a baseline solution.
     - Evaluate the solution's makespan and identify bottlenecks in job processing.
     - If initial results are not satisfactory, switch to `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `least_work_remaining_66c9` to explore different priority criteria.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
2. **Local Optimization Heuristics**
   - **Objective:** Refine the initial solution by making local changes to reduce the makespan.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` to perform swaps and reduce the makespan iteratively.
     - Use `shift_operator_109f` to test shifting operations and evaluate its impact.
     - If improvements plateau, attempt `3opt_6ee0` to introduce more complex swaps.

3. **Dynamic Scoring Heuristics**
   - **Objective:** Adaptively adjust priorities based on the current state to improve efficiency.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Test `first_come_first_served_af26` with dynamic scoring to adapt to changes in machine availability and job alignment.
     - If certain jobs consistently delay makespan, try `most_work_remaining_df20` for a different perspective on job priorities.
     - Use dynamic scoring as a way to continuously refine job ordering without committing to static priorities.

#### Phase 3: Specialized Scenarios
4. **Specialized Scenarios Heuristics**
   - **Objective:** Address specific characteristics of the problem instance that may require tailored approaches.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - If certain jobs dominate the schedule, consider `longest_job_next_2e23` to focus on the most time-consuming tasks.
     - For jobs with significant processing time variations, `shortest_job_next_5b42` can help address short tasks quickly.
     - Use this category sparingly to target specific issues revealed during earlier phases.

### Iterative Approach
- **Evaluation:** After applying a heuristic, always evaluate the solution's performance in terms of makespan and resource utilization.
- **Switching:** If a heuristic no longer provides significant improvements, switch categories or heuristics.
- **Diversity:** Regularly alternate between categories to prevent getting stuck in local optima and explore diverse solution spaces.
- **Feedback Loop:** Use solution feedback to guide heuristic selection, focusing on reducing bottlenecks and balancing machine loads.

This strategic guide is flexible and can be adapted based on the problem's specific characteristics and observed performance of the heuristics. The key is to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining the solution while considering different heuristic approaches.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[20, 87, 31, 76, 17], [25, 32, 24, 18, 81], [72, 23, 28, 58, 99], [86, 76, 97, 45, 90], [27, 42, 48, 17, 46], [67, 98, 48, 27, 62], [28, 12, 19, 80, 50], [63, 94, 98, 50, 80], [14, 75, 50, 41, 55], [72, 18, 37, 79, 61]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:52.86
max_operation_time:99
min_operation_time:12
std_deviation_operation_time:26.944394593310125
job_operation_time_range:87
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 11 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since there have been no operations scheduled yet, it's beneficial to start with a priority-based heuristic to construct an initial feasible solution. This approach will allow you to quickly schedule jobs and establish a baseline, which can be subsequently refined using other heuristics. Starting with priority-based heuristics will help in identifying immediate scheduling opportunities and setting the stage for more complex optimization in later phases.
current_makespan: 0->25
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Since the initial heuristic has started scheduling operations and established a baseline makespan, it is beneficial to switch to a local optimization strategy. This approach can focus on refining the current solution by making targeted changes to reduce the makespan and improve job and machine utilization. The current state shows an opportunity to enhance the schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing job sequences on machines.
current_makespan: 25->25
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->1
---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, only one operation has been scheduled, and the makespan has not improved with the last local optimization step. Returning to a priority-based heuristic can help schedule more operations and build a more substantial base for further optimization. This approach will focus on advancing the scheduling process and potentially increasing the number of finished operations, which can then be further refined with other heuristics.
current_makespan: 25->25
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state indicates that only two operations have been scheduled, and the makespan has not improved significantly. Since the priority-based approach has already attempted to advance the solution by scheduling operations, it is now beneficial to focus on local optimization. This category can help refine the schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing job sequences on machines. By doing so, we can potentially reduce the makespan and improve overall efficiency. Local optimization can exploit the current partial schedule and enhance it by making targeted changes, thereby improving machine utilization and reducing idle times.
current_makespan: 25->25
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->2
---Round 4---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state shows that only two operations have been scheduled, and there has been no improvement in the makespan with the local optimization approach. Switching back to a priority-based heuristic can help in advancing the scheduling process by adding more operations to the schedule. Given the early stage of the solution and the need to build a more substantial base, a priority-based heuristic like shortest_processing_time_first_d471 or least_work_remaining_66c9 can facilitate progress by focusing on scheduling operations that are more likely to reduce the makespan or balance machine load. This will provide a more developed solution that can be further refined with local optimization or dynamic scoring in future steps.
current_makespan: 25->57
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 5---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where only three operations have been scheduled and there is a significant gap in makespan, it would be beneficial to switch to a local optimization heuristic. This approach can potentially refine the existing schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing the sequence of operations on machines. Since priority-based heuristics have been employed several times with limited progress, local optimization could provide the necessary adjustments to decrease makespan and enhance machine utilization.
current_makespan: 57->57
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->3
---Round 6---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state shows that only three operations have been scheduled, and the makespan remains relatively high with no jobs completed. Priority-based heuristics can help in advancing the scheduling process by adding more operations to the schedule. Since local optimization strategies have been applied with limited success, focusing on scheduling more operations can build a more substantial base. This will potentially reduce idle times and balance the load across machines, setting the stage for more effective optimization in subsequent phases.
current_makespan: 57->72
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->4
---Round 7---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state indicates that only four operations have been scheduled, and no jobs have been completed, with a relatively high makespan of 72. Priority-based heuristics have been used several times, resulting in limited progress. Switching to local optimization can help refine the current solution by focusing on reducing idle times and optimizing sequences on the machines. This approach can potentially decrease the makespan and improve machine utilization, addressing the inefficiencies observed in the current schedule.
current_makespan: 72->72
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->4
---Round 8---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current state indicates limited progress with local optimization, as the makespan has not decreased, and no jobs have been completed. With only four operations scheduled and a high makespan, returning to a priority-based heuristic can help advance the scheduling process. By focusing on scheduling more operations, we can potentially build a more substantial base for future optimizations. Priority-based heuristics can help address the imbalance between finished and unfinished jobs and improve machine utilization, setting the stage for more effective optimization in subsequent phases.
current_makespan: 72->81
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->5
---Round 9---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state shows limited progress in completing operations and reducing the makespan, with only five operations scheduled and no finished jobs. Given that priority-based heuristics have been used extensively with marginal gains, switching to local optimization could provide the necessary adjustments to improve the current solution. Local optimization can help refine the job sequences on machines by reducing idle times and optimizing the order of operations, potentially decreasing the makespan and improving machine utilization. This approach will address the inefficiencies observed in the current schedule and may lead to a more balanced and effective job allocation.
current_makespan: 81->81
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 5->5
---Round 10---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: dynamic_scoring
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state shows that progress has been slow, with only five operations completed and no finished jobs, despite multiple rounds of local optimization and priority-based heuristics. The makespan has not improved in the last few rounds. Switching to dynamic scoring can provide a fresh approach by adapting priorities based on the current state, which may help in scheduling operations more effectively and reducing idle times. This strategy can dynamically adjust to changes in machine availability and job completion status, potentially leading to improved machine utilization and a reduced makespan.
current_makespan: 81->101
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 5->5

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:

average_idle_time_per_machine:50.0
proportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0
proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: first_come_first_served_af26(dynamic_scoring). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,dynamic_scoring,specialized_scenarios

explanation:The current solution has seen limited progress, with only five operations completed and no finished jobs. The makespan has increased, and machine utilization remains suboptimal. Returning to a priority-based heuristic can help schedule more operations, build a more substantial solution base, and address the imbalance between finished and unfinished jobs. By focusing on scheduling operations that are more likely to reduce the makespan and balance machine load, we can set the stage for more effective optimization in subsequent phases.
