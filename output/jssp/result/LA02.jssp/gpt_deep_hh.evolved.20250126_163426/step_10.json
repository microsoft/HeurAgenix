In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine.

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a suggested framework:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Construction\n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**\n   - **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible initial solution by prioritizing jobs.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Start with a simple priority-based heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish a baseline solution.\n     - Evaluate the solution's makespan and identify bottlenecks in job processing.\n     - If initial results are not satisfactory, switch to `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `least_work_remaining_66c9` to explore different priority criteria.\n\n#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement\n2. **Local Optimization Heuristics**\n   - **Objective:** Refine the initial solution by making local changes to reduce the makespan.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` to perform swaps and reduce the makespan iteratively.\n     - Use `shift_operator_109f` to test shifting operations and evaluate its impact.\n     - If improvements plateau, attempt `3opt_6ee0` to introduce more complex swaps.\n\n3. **Dynamic Scoring Heuristics**\n   - **Objective:** Adaptively adjust priorities based on the current state to improve efficiency.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Test `first_come_first_served_af26` with dynamic scoring to adapt to changes in machine availability and job alignment.\n     - If certain jobs consistently delay makespan, try `most_work_remaining_df20` for a different perspective on job priorities.\n     - Use dynamic scoring as a way to continuously refine job ordering without committing to static priorities.\n\n#### Phase 3: Specialized Scenarios\n4. **Specialized Scenarios Heuristics**\n   - **Objective:** Address specific characteristics of the problem instance that may require tailored approaches.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - If certain jobs dominate the schedule, consider `longest_job_next_2e23` to focus on the most time-consuming tasks.\n     - For jobs with significant processing time variations, `shortest_job_next_5b42` can help address short tasks quickly.\n     - Use this category sparingly to target specific issues revealed during earlier phases.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Evaluation:** After applying a heuristic, always evaluate the solution's performance in terms of makespan and resource utilization.\n- **Switching:** If a heuristic no longer provides significant improvements, switch categories or heuristics.\n- **Diversity:** Regularly alternate between categories to prevent getting stuck in local optima and explore diverse solution spaces.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Use solution feedback to guide heuristic selection, focusing on reducing bottlenecks and balancing machine loads.\n\nThis strategic guide is flexible and can be adapted based on the problem's specific characteristics and observed performance of the heuristics. The key is to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining the solution while considering different heuristic approaches."

This approach will allow you to quickly schedule jobs and establish a baseline, which can be subsequently refined using other heuristics. Starting with priority-based heuristics will help in identifying immediate scheduling opportunities and setting the stage for more complex optimization in later phases.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->25\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the initial heuristic has started scheduling operations and established a baseline makespan, it is beneficial to switch to a local optimization strategy. This approach can focus on refining the current solution by making targeted changes to reduce the makespan and improve job and machine utilization. The current state shows an opportunity to enhance the schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing job sequences on machines.\ncurrent_makespan: 25->25\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->1\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, only one operation has been scheduled, and the makespan has not improved with the last local optimization step. Returning to a priority-based heuristic can help schedule more operations and build a more substantial base for further optimization. This approach will focus on advancing the scheduling process and potentially increasing the number of finished operations, which can then be further refined with other heuristics.\ncurrent_makespan: 25->25\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state indicates that only two operations have been scheduled, and the makespan has not improved significantly. Since the priority-based approach has already attempted to advance the solution by scheduling operations, it is now beneficial to focus on local optimization. This category can help refine the schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing job sequences on machines. By doing so, we can potentially reduce the makespan and improve overall efficiency. Local optimization can exploit the current partial schedule and enhance it by making targeted changes, thereby improving machine utilization and reducing idle times.\ncurrent_makespan: 25->25\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->2\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: first_come_first_served_af26\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state shows that only two operations have been scheduled, and there has been no improvement in the makespan with the local optimization approach. Switching back to a priority-based heuristic can help in advancing the scheduling process by adding more operations to the schedule. Given the early stage of the solution and the need to build a more substantial base, a priority-based heuristic like shortest_processing_time_first_d471 or least_work_remaining_66c9 can facilitate progress by focusing on scheduling operations that are more likely to reduce the makespan or balance machine load. This will provide a more developed solution that can be further refined with local optimization or dynamic scoring in future steps.\ncurrent_makespan: 25->57\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where only three operations have been scheduled and there is a significant gap in makespan, it would be beneficial to switch to a local optimization heuristic. This approach can potentially refine the existing schedule by addressing idle times and optimizing the sequence of operations on machines. Since priority-based heuristics have been employed several times with limited progress, local optimization could provide the necessary adjustments to decrease makespan and enhance machine utilization.\ncurrent_makespan: 57->57\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->3\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state shows that only three operations have been scheduled, and the makespan remains relatively high with no jobs completed. Priority-based heuristics can help in advancing the scheduling process by adding more operations to the schedule. Since local optimization strategies have been applied with limited success, focusing on scheduling more operations can build a more substantial base. This will potentially reduce idle times and balance the load across machines, setting the stage for more effective optimization in subsequent phases.\ncurrent_makespan: 57->72\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state indicates that only four operations have been scheduled, and no jobs have been completed, with a relatively high makespan of 72. Priority-based heuristics have been used several times, resulting in limited progress. Switching to local optimization can help refine the current solution by focusing on reducing idle times and optimizing sequences on the machines. This approach can potentially decrease the makespan and improve machine utilization, addressing the inefficiencies observed in the current schedule.\ncurrent_makespan: 72->72\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->4\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current state indicates limited progress with local optimization, as the makespan has not decreased, and no jobs have been completed. With only four operations scheduled and a high makespan, returning to a priority-based heuristic can help advance the scheduling process. By focusing on scheduling more operations, we can potentially build a more substantial base for future optimizations. Priority-based heuristics can help address the imbalance between finished and unfinished jobs and improve machine utilization, setting the stage for more effective optimization in subsequent phases.\ncurrent_makespan: 72->81\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->5\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state shows limited progress in completing operations and reducing the makespan, with only five operations scheduled and no finished jobs. Given that priority-based heuristics have been used extensively with marginal gains, switching to local optimization could provide the necessary adjustments to improve the current solution. Local optimization can help refine the job sequences on machines by reducing idle times and optimizing the order of operations, potentially decreasing the makespan and improving machine utilization. This approach will address the inefficiencies observed in the current schedule and may lead to a more balanced and effective job allocation.\ncurrent_makespan: 81->81\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->5\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nmachine_0: 0->1\nmachine_1: 2\nmachine_2: 1\nmachine_3: \nmachine_4: 1\n\nfinished_jobs:[]\nunfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\njob_operation_index:[1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\njob_last_operation_end_times:[20, 81, 72, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nmachine_operation_index:[2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nmachine_last_operation_end_times:[81, 72, 57, 0, 25]\nfinished_operation_num:5\ncurrent_makespan:81\nnum_finished_jobs:0\nnum_unfinished_jobs:10\naverage_job_completion:17.3\nmax_job_completion_time:81\nmin_job_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_job_completion_time:30.25243791829016\naverage_machine_completion:47.0\nmax_machine_completion_time:81\nmin_machine_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_machine_completion_time:30.245660845813898\naverage_idle_time_per_machine:34.0\nproportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0\nproportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: _2opt_f9c1(local_optimization).

The makespan has not improved in the last few rounds. Switching to dynamic scoring can provide a fresh approach by adapting priorities based on the current state, which may help in scheduling operations more effectively and reducing idle times. This strategy can dynamically adjust to changes in machine availability and job completion status, potentially leading to improved machine utilization and a reduced makespan.\n***"
