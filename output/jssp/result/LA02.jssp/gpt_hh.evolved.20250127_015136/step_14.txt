I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making a sequence of discrete decisions (i.e., the ordering of jobs on machines) to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing the makespan. JSSP is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, and heuristic methods are commonly employed to find good solutions within reasonable time frames.

Your framework, which includes a `Solution` class and various operators for modifying solutions, is consistent with approaches used in combinatorial optimization. These operators (AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, etc.) are typical in heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or tabu search, which are often used to tackle JSSP.

The heuristic function signature you provided also seems appropriate for implementing various heuristic strategies, allowing for flexibility in input data and the types of operators applied.

Overall, the approach you've described aligns well with common practices for solving combinatorial optimization problems using heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic involves understanding the specific conditions or problem instances where a particular heuristic might perform well. Here’s an overview of possible scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when there are jobs with significantly varying processing times. Prioritizing shorter tasks can help minimize waiting times on machines and improve overall flow efficiency, particularly when machine availability is a bottleneck.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with high variance in job processing times and when minimizing machine idle times is crucial.

2. **first_come_first_served_af26**: 
   - **Scenario**: FCFS can be useful in environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized, and jobs are relatively uniform in size and complexity.
   - **Quantification**: Best for datasets with uniform job processing times and when scheduling fairness or simplicity is a primary concern.

3. **most_work_remaining_df20**: 
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for situations where it’s beneficial to focus on jobs that have the most work left, ensuring that long jobs don’t delay completion excessively.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable when there are few long jobs that dominate the makespan and need prioritization to avoid extensive delays.

4. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful in fine-tuning schedules by exploring local shifts within machine queues to optimize the sequence of operations.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for local optimization in scenarios where small adjustments can lead to significant makespan reductions.

5. **_3opt_6ee0**: 
   - **Scenario**: Adapted for scenarios where swapping operations can significantly impact the schedule, especially when there are complex interdependencies between operations across machines.
   - **Quantification**: Beneficial in highly constrained environments where sequence optimization can unlock better schedules.

6. **longest_job_next_2e23**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when it's crucial to address bottlenecks caused by jobs with the longest processing times as early as possible.
   - **Quantification**: Best suited for datasets where a few jobs disproportionately affect the makespan due to their length.

7. **_2opt_f9c1**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in exploring the solution space by swapping operations to seek improvements in schedule efficiency.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for scenarios where potential gains from reordering operations are significant due to complex inter-job dependencies.

8. **random_6512**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or in exploratory phases where randomness can help escape local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when diversification of solutions is needed, and there is no clear heuristic advantage.

9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**: 
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the longest individual operations, which can help balance the load across machines and reduce idle times.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for scenarios where operation durations vary widely and balancing machine workload is crucial.

10. **least_work_remaining_66c9**: 
    - **Scenario**: Effective when the goal is to quickly complete jobs and free up resources for other tasks.
    - **Quantification**: Best for datasets where completing shorter jobs can significantly free up machine capacity.

11. **shortest_job_next_5b42**: 
    - **Scenario**: Prioritizes quick wins by completing shorter jobs first, which can be advantageous in environments where throughput or responsiveness is critical.
    - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with a mix of job sizes, where shorter jobs can be completed quickly to improve flow.

These scenarios provide a general guide, but the effectiveness of each heuristic can vary based on specific problem instances, constraints, and objectives. Testing and validation on real-world data or representative problem instances are crucial to determine the most suitable heuristic for a given scenario.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the data and the results from previous rounds, the `shift_operator_109f` heuristic has shown potential in reducing the makespan significantly during round 12, although it did not show further improvement in round 13. Given that the current solution has already completed all jobs, and considering the absence of further improvements with other heuristics, it may be beneficial to explore a few more steps with `shift_operator_109f` to see if it can still uncover additional local optimizations.

Given the results and current state:

1. **Selected Heuristic**: shift_operator_109f
2. **Running Steps**: 5
3. **Explanation**: The recent use of `shift_operator_109f` led to a significant reduction in makespan by 105 units, which indicates its capacity for making beneficial local adjustments. Although no further improvement was observed in the last round, continuing with this heuristic for a few more steps might reveal additional opportunities for optimizing the schedule. The strategy is to explore potential local optima that might have been missed previously.

Here's the formatted response:
