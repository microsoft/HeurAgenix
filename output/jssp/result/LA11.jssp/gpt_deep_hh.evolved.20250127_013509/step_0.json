In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nlocal_search: these heuristics employ local search techniques to improve the current solution by making small adjustments, such as shifting operations or performing swaps.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\n\ndiversity_enhancement: this heuristic includes mechanisms to adapt based on job diversity, potentially making it more robust across varied datasets.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\n\niterative_improvement: this heuristic includes periodic local optimization steps (e.g., k-flip, swap), aiming to iteratively improve the solution over time.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\njob_num:20\nmachine_num:5\njob_operation_sequence:[[2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [4, 2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 4, 2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]]\njob_operation_time:[[34, 21, 53, 55, 95], [21, 52, 71, 16, 26], [12, 42, 31, 98, 39], [66, 77, 79, 55, 77], [83, 37, 34, 19, 64], [79, 43, 92, 62, 54], [93, 77, 87, 87, 69], [83, 24, 41, 38, 60], [25, 49, 44, 98, 17], [96, 75, 43, 77, 79], [95, 76, 7, 28, 35], [10, 95, 61, 9, 35], [91, 59, 59, 46, 16], [27, 52, 43, 28, 50], [9, 87, 41, 39, 45], [54, 20, 43, 14, 71], [33, 28, 26, 78, 37], [89, 33, 8, 66, 42], [84, 69, 94, 74, 27], [81, 45, 78, 69, 96]]\ntotal_operation_num:100\naverage_operation_time:53.51\nmax_operation_time:98\nmin_operation_time:7\nstd_deviation_operation_time:26.354314637265755\njob_operation_time_range:91\naverage_job_length:5.0\nmax_job_length:5\nmin_job_length:5\nmachine_utilization:0.8\njob_diversity:5\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic category and when they might be most effectively applied.\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n- **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible initial solution that can serve as a baseline for further improvement.\n- **Priority:** Efficiency in solution construction rather than optimality.\n\n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Start with a simple heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` for a baseline solution.\n     - Test `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to evaluate if it provides a better starting point by reducing the initial makespan.\n     - Consider `most_work_remaining_df20` to balance workload distribution across machines.\n   - **Rationale:** These heuristics are computationally less intensive and can provide a good starting solution by focusing on either minimizing the makespan or balancing workloads.\n\n2. **Diversity Enhancement:**\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Introduce `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` if diversity in operation times and machine availability is high.\n   - **Rationale:** This helps in exploring different areas of the solution space early, potentially finding a more promising starting point.\n\n#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement\n- **Objective:** Enhance the quality of the initial solution through iterative refinements.\n- **Priority:** Incremental improvement of solution quality.\n\n1. **Local Search Heuristics:**\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Apply `shift_operator_109f` to explore small local adjustments that can improve the makespan.\n     - Use `_2opt_f9c1` and `_3opt_6ee0` for more aggressive local search improvements, focusing on swaps that can significantly reduce the makespan.\n   - **Rationale:** These heuristics are effective in fine-tuning solutions by exploring nearby configurations and identifying beneficial swaps or shifts.\n\n2. **Iterative Improvement:**\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` periodically to reassess and re-optimize job scheduling as the solution evolves.\n   - **Rationale:** Regularly revisiting and reapplying local optimization can help in escaping local minima and further refining the solution.\n\n#### Phase 3: Solution Diversification and Exploration\n- **Objective:** Avoid stagnation and explore new areas of the solution space.\n- **Priority:** Balancing between exploiting current solutions and exploring new possibilities.\n\n1. **Diversity Enhancement:**\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Reintroduce `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to shift focus and explore alternative scheduling paths that might have been overlooked.\n   - **Rationale:** Shaking up the solution space can prevent getting trapped in suboptimal regions and may lead to finding better solutions.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Cycle through different categories**: Alternate between priority-based, local search, and diversity enhancement heuristics to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Evaluate performance regularly**: After each heuristic application, assess the solution's quality (e.g., makespan, machine utilization) and decide whether to continue with the current heuristic or switch to another.\n- **Flexible adaptation**: Be ready to adapt the strategy based on intermediate results and problem-specific characteristics.\n\nThis framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to tackling JSSP, allowing for experimentation and adaptation throughout the solution process."
