I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations to be performed on a set of machines, which is a typical combinatorial task. The use of heuristics is a common approach to tackle such problems, especially when exact methods become computationally infeasible due to the problem's complexity. Your framework with solutions, operators, and heuristic functions seems well-aligned with the nature of combinatorial optimization problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_search,diversity_enhancement,iterative_improvement

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on certain criteria such as work remaining or processing time, aiming to optimize the sequence of operations.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_search: these heuristics employ local search techniques to improve the current solution by making small adjustments, such as shifting operations or performing swaps.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.

diversity_enhancement: this heuristic includes mechanisms to adapt based on job diversity, potentially making it more robust across varied datasets.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.

iterative_improvement: this heuristic includes periodic local optimization steps (e.g., k-flip, swap), aiming to iteratively improve the solution over time.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:20
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [4, 2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 4, 2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[34, 21, 53, 55, 95], [21, 52, 71, 16, 26], [12, 42, 31, 98, 39], [66, 77, 79, 55, 77], [83, 37, 34, 19, 64], [79, 43, 92, 62, 54], [93, 77, 87, 87, 69], [83, 24, 41, 38, 60], [25, 49, 44, 98, 17], [96, 75, 43, 77, 79], [95, 76, 7, 28, 35], [10, 95, 61, 9, 35], [91, 59, 59, 46, 16], [27, 52, 43, 28, 50], [9, 87, 41, 39, 45], [54, 20, 43, 14, 71], [33, 28, 26, 78, 37], [89, 33, 8, 66, 42], [84, 69, 94, 74, 27], [81, 45, 78, 69, 96]]
total_operation_num:100

machine_utilization:0.8

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Certainly! Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic category and when they might be most effectively applied.

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible initial solution that can serve as a baseline for further improvement.
- **Priority:** Efficiency in solution construction rather than optimality.

1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Start with a simple heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` for a baseline solution.
     - Test `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to evaluate if it provides a better starting point by reducing the initial makespan.
     - Consider `most_work_remaining_df20` to balance workload distribution across machines.
   - **Rationale:** These heuristics are computationally less intensive and can provide a good starting solution by focusing on either minimizing the makespan or balancing workloads.

2. **Diversity Enhancement:**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Introduce `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` if diversity in operation times and machine availability is high.
   - **Rationale:** This helps in exploring different areas of the solution space early, potentially finding a more promising starting point.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
- **Objective:** Enhance the quality of the initial solution through iterative refinements.
- **Priority:** Incremental improvement of solution quality.

1. **Local Search Heuristics:**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Apply `shift_operator_109f` to explore small local adjustments that can improve the makespan.
     - Use `_2opt_f9c1` and `_3opt_6ee0` for more aggressive local search improvements, focusing on swaps that can significantly reduce the makespan.
   - **Rationale:** These heuristics are effective in fine-tuning solutions by exploring nearby configurations and identifying beneficial swaps or shifts.

2. **Iterative Improvement:**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` periodically to reassess and re-optimize job scheduling as the solution evolves.
   - **Rationale:** Regularly revisiting and reapplying local optimization can help in escaping local minima and further refining the solution.

#### Phase 3: Solution Diversification and Exploration
- **Objective:** Avoid stagnation and explore new areas of the solution space.
- **Priority:** Balancing between exploiting current solutions and exploring new possibilities.

1. **Diversity Enhancement:**
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Reintroduce `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to shift focus and explore alternative scheduling paths that might have been overlooked.
   - **Rationale:** Shaking up the solution space can prevent getting trapped in suboptimal regions and may lead to finding better solutions.

### Iterative Approach
- **Cycle through different categories**: Alternate between priority-based, local search, and diversity enhancement heuristics to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.
- **Evaluate performance regularly**: After each heuristic application, assess the solution's quality (e.g., makespan, machine utilization) and decide whether to continue with the current heuristic or switch to another.
- **Flexible adaptation**: Be ready to adapt the strategy based on intermediate results and problem-specific characteristics.

This framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to tackling JSSP, allowing for experimentation and adaptation throughout the solution process.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:

job_operation_time:[[34, 21, 53, 55, 95], [21, 52, 71, 16, 26], [12, 42, 31, 98, 39], [66, 77, 79, 55, 77], [83, 37, 34, 19, 64], [79, 43, 92, 62, 54], [93, 77, 87, 87, 69], [83, 24, 41, 38, 60], [25, 49, 44, 98, 17], [96, 75, 43, 77, 79], [95, 76, 7, 28, 35], [10, 95, 61, 9, 35], [91, 59, 59, 46, 16], [27, 52, 43, 28, 50], [9, 87, 41, 39, 45], [54, 20, 43, 14, 71], [33, 28, 26, 78, 37], [89, 33, 8, 66, 42], [84, 69, 94, 74, 27], [81, 45, 78, 69, 96]]

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since we are at the very beginning with no operations scheduled and all jobs unfinished, starting with a priority-based heuristic can help us quickly construct an initial feasible solution. These heuristics are designed to provide a good starting point by considering job priorities and can set a foundation for further improvements.
current_makespan: 0->34
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_search
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  After constructing an initial feasible solution using a priority-based heuristic, it's beneficial to shift to a local search approach. Local search heuristics can help in fine-tuning the solution by exploring nearby configurations and making small adjustments, such as shifting operations or performing swaps, to reduce the makespan and improve the solution quality. This shift allows us to leverage the established initial schedule and refine it further to achieve better performance.
current_makespan: 34->34
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->1
---Round 2---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state with only one operation completed and no jobs finished, it may be beneficial to switch back to a priority-based heuristic. This can help ensure that jobs with high priority based on certain criteria (such as shortest processing time or most work remaining) are scheduled next, potentially leading to more efficient completion of jobs. The priority-based approach can provide a fresh perspective on constructing the schedule, ensuring that the makespan is minimized while improving the progression of unfinished jobs.
current_makespan: 34->34
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:

average_idle_time_per_machine:23.0
proportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0
proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: most_work_remaining_df20(priority_based). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_search,diversity_enhancement,iterative_improvement

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:local_search
explanation:Given the current state with only two operations completed and no jobs finished, it's beneficial to leverage local search techniques. These heuristics can help in fine-tuning and improving the current solution by making small adjustments, such as shifting operations or performing swaps, to further reduce the makespan and enhance the solution quality. This approach allows us to explore nearby configurations and potentially unlock better performance by optimizing the sequence of operations for the unfinished jobs.
