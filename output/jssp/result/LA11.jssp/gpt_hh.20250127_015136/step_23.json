In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

It\u2019s useful in relatively stable schedules where fine-tuning is required.\n   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, tightness of schedule.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where minimizing idle time for machines is crucial. It helps in reducing the overall makespan by addressing the shortest tasks first.\n   - **Quantified by**: Average processing time, variance in operation times.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when the schedule allows for significant rearrangement and where complex sequences might need optimization. It\u2019s a more aggressive heuristic for finding potentially better local optima.\n   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, flexibility in operation sequence.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when it\u2019s important to ensure that longer jobs do not delay the overall schedule completion. It prevents bottlenecks caused by long jobs.\n   - **Quantified by**: Total job processing times, job length distribution.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in scenarios where non-adjacent swaps can lead to reduced makespan. Suitable for schedules where job sequences are initially suboptimal.\n   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, initial makespan vs. best-known makespan.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Scenario**: Can be useful for diversification in search strategies or in environments with high uncertainty or variability. It may uncover non-intuitive solutions.\n   - **Quantified by**: Variability and unpredictability of operation times.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where it\u2019s crucial to minimize the risk of long delays by prioritizing jobs with significant work remaining.\n   - **Quantified by**: Total remaining work for jobs, job completion deadlines.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in minimizing the number of setups or transitions by focusing on lengthy tasks early. It can reduce idle times for machines handling long tasks.\n   - **Quantified by**: Length of operations, machine setup times.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when aiming to quickly complete smaller jobs to free up resources for larger tasks, often enhancing throughput.\n   - **Quantified by**: Remaining work distribution, resource constraints.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where quick wins are necessary to keep the system fluid and responsive, reducing the waiting time for short jobs.\n    - **Quantified by**: Job processing time distribution, system responsiveness needs.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in highly predictable environments or where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimization.\n    - **Quantified by**: Arrival time distribution, fairness vs. optimization trade-offs.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best applied based on the specific characteristics of the scheduling problem at hand.

How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
