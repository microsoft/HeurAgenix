I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

***is_cop:yes***

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. The framework you have described, including the `Solution` class and various `Operator` classes (such as `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, and `ShiftOperator`), is suitable for representing and modifying solutions in the context of JSSP. Additionally, the standardized heuristic function signature you provided appears to be well-structured for integrating various heuristic algorithms within your framework.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing when each heuristic might be most applicable requires understanding the characteristics of the job shop scheduling environment and the specific strengths of each heuristic. Hereâs a breakdown of scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: Situations where small local improvements can lead to significant reductions in makespan. Itâs useful in relatively stable schedules where fine-tuning is required.
   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, tightness of schedule.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where minimizing idle time for machines is crucial. It helps in reducing the overall makespan by addressing the shortest tasks first.
   - **Quantified by**: Average processing time, variance in operation times.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used when the schedule allows for significant rearrangement and where complex sequences might need optimization. Itâs a more aggressive heuristic for finding potentially better local optima.
   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, flexibility in operation sequence.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when itâs important to ensure that longer jobs do not delay the overall schedule completion. It prevents bottlenecks caused by long jobs.
   - **Quantified by**: Total job processing times, job length distribution.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in scenarios where non-adjacent swaps can lead to reduced makespan. Suitable for schedules where job sequences are initially suboptimal.
   - **Quantified by**: Number of operations, initial makespan vs. best-known makespan.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Can be useful for diversification in search strategies or in environments with high uncertainty or variability. It may uncover non-intuitive solutions.
   - **Quantified by**: Variability and unpredictability of operation times.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where itâs crucial to minimize the risk of long delays by prioritizing jobs with significant work remaining.
   - **Quantified by**: Total remaining work for jobs, job completion deadlines.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in minimizing the number of setups or transitions by focusing on lengthy tasks early. It can reduce idle times for machines handling long tasks.
   - **Quantified by**: Length of operations, machine setup times.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used when aiming to quickly complete smaller jobs to free up resources for larger tasks, often enhancing throughput.
   - **Quantified by**: Remaining work distribution, resource constraints.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where quick wins are necessary to keep the system fluid and responsive, reducing the waiting time for short jobs.
    - **Quantified by**: Job processing time distribution, system responsiveness needs.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in highly predictable environments or where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimization.
    - **Quantified by**: Arrival time distribution, fairness vs. optimization trade-offs.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best applied based on the specific characteristics of the scheduling problem at hand. Quantifying the scenarios typically involves understanding the distribution of job and operation characteristics, such as processing times, arrival times, and overall job lengths.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state of the solution and the progress from previous heuristics, let's evaluate the next steps:

1. **Current Situation**:
   - The most recent heuristic, `shift_operator_109f`, did not result in any improvement in makespan or completion of operations.
   - There is still a substantial number of unfinished jobs and operations.
   - The current makespan is relatively high, and there are no finished jobs yet.

2. **Potential Next Steps**:
   - Since `shift_operator_109f` did not yield improvements, it might be beneficial to switch strategies.
   - Considering the substantial number of unfinished jobs and the high variability in operation times, applying a heuristic that addresses these factors might be more effective.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - **Heuristic Selection**: Use the `longest_job_next_2e23` heuristic, which could help in balancing the load by focusing on longer jobs that have not yet been prioritized, potentially reducing the makespan and evening out the workload across machines.

4. **Running Steps**:
   - Given that previous heuristics have been run for 5 steps, it's reasonable to continue with 5 steps initially for consistency and to observe any resulting changes.

Here is the recommended response format:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
running steps: 5
explanation: Switching to the longest job next heuristic aims to balance the workload by prioritizing jobs with the longest remaining processing time. This approach may help reduce the makespan and improve machine utilization by addressing potential bottlenecks early.***
