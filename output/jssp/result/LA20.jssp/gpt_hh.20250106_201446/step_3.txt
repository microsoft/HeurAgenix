I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding the best combination or sequence of operations across machines to optimize production efficiency (e.g., minimizing makespan). Moreover, the provided solution framework, operator definitions, and heuristic function signature are consistent with solving combinatorial optimization problems using heuristics. The design allows for iterative improvement of solutions through the application of operators guided by heuristic strategies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). Below is an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios they are best suited for, along with possible quantifiable metrics for determining their applicability:

---

### **1. `first_come_first_served_6c4f`**
- **Scenario**: 
  - This heuristic is most applicable when job arrival order is predetermined or prioritized externally (e.g., real-time scheduling where jobs arrive dynamically).
  - Useful in systems where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over efficiency.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High job arrival frequency (dynamic scheduling).
  - Low variance in processing times across jobs and machines.

---

### **2. `least_work_remaining_66c9`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Suitable when minimizing total workload (makespan) is critical.
  - Effective when the remaining workload across jobs varies significantly.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High variance in total processing times across jobs (`std_dev(job_remaining_times)`).
  - High average remaining workload across unfinished jobs (`mean(job_remaining_times)`).

---

### **3. `longest_job_next_2e23`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Useful when prioritizing jobs with the longest workload to avoid leaving them unfinished toward the end.
  - Can help balance makespan by addressing "bottleneck" jobs early.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High variance in total processing times across jobs (`std_dev(job_remaining_times)`).
  - Large number of jobs with significantly higher workloads than others (`max(job_remaining_times)` > `threshold`).

---

### **4. `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Effective when the longest individual operations dominate the schedule and create bottlenecks on certain machines.
  - Suitable for balancing machine workloads.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High variance in operation times across machines (`std_dev(operation_times)`).
  - Machines with disproportionately long operation times (`max(operation_times)` > `threshold`).

---

### **5. `most_work_remaining_930e`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Similar to `longest_job_next`, but focuses on jobs with the maximum total workload rather than the longest individual operations.
  - Best for reducing overall makespan in cases of high workload imbalance across jobs.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High variance in total workload across jobs (`std_dev(job_total_workload)`).
  - High number of unfinished jobs with significant workloads (`unfinished_jobs > threshold`).

---

### **6. `random_6512`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Useful for generating diverse solutions or exploring new parts of the solution space (e.g., in combination with metaheuristics like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms).
  - Effective for breaking out of local optima.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - Stagnation in solution quality improvement over iterations (`iteration_quality_change < epsilon`).
  - High diversity required in solution space exploration.

---

### **7. `shift_operator_109f`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Applicable for fine-tuning solutions by rearranging operations within the same machine.
  - Best used when most jobs are already scheduled, and small adjustments can significantly impact the makespan.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - Near-optimal solutions with minor inefficiencies (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan < threshold`).
  - High variance in operation sequences within machines (`std_dev(machine_job_sequences)`).

---

### **8. `shortest_job_next_5b42`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Ideal for minimizing waiting times for short jobs, especially when there are many short jobs with small workloads.
  - Effective in scenarios where fairness or minimizing job lateness is prioritized.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High number of short jobs relative to the total (`mean(job_remaining_times) < threshold`).
  - High variance in job processing times (`std_dev(job_processing_times)`).

---

### **9. `shortest_processing_time_first_c374`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Suitable for minimizing idle time on machines by scheduling the shortest operations first.
  - Best for reducing machine-level bottlenecks.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - High variance in operation times across machines (`std_dev(operation_times)`).
  - Significant number of short operations across jobs (`mean(operation_times) < threshold`).

---

### **10. `_2opt_f9c1`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Effective for local optimization by swapping two operations and reducing makespan.
  - Best used when the solution is near-optimal but contains small inefficiencies due to poor operation order.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - Near-optimal solutions (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan < threshold`).
  - High potential for improvement in operation ordering (`operation_ordering_score < threshold`).

---

### **11. `_3opt_6ee0`**
- **Scenario**:
  - Suitable for more aggressive local optimization, allowing exploration of a broader set of operation rearrangements.
  - Effective when `_2opt` is insufficient for achieving significant improvements in makespan.
- **Quantifiable Metrics**:
  - Moderate-to-high suboptimality in solutions (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan > threshold`).
  - High potential for improvement in operation ordering (`operation_ordering_score < threshold`).

---

### **Summary**
To quantify the scenarios for applying these heuristics, the following metrics can be used:
1. **Variance in Job and Operation Times**: High variance suggests prioritization-based heuristics (e.g., `least_work_remaining`, `longest_processing_time_first`) might be effective.
2. **Makespan Suboptimality**: Low suboptimality favors local optimization heuristics (`_2opt`, `_3opt`, `shift_operator`).
3. **Diversity Needs**: Stagnation or lack of diversity in solutions suggests random heuristics (`random`) or exploratory methods.
4. **System Characteristics**: Dynamic systems with real-time job arrival favor simple heuristics like `first_come_first_served`.

Each heuristic has distinct strengths, and selecting the right one depends on the current state of the solution and problem characteristics.

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: 27.46), making this heuristic suitable for handling workload variance. Running 10 steps will provide a solid foundation for the initial partial solution.
Delta of current_makespan: 400

Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: 120.0) and the presence of unfinished jobs with significant workloads, prioritizing the longest job next can help address bottleneck jobs early. This heuristic aims to balance the makespan by focusing on jobs with the largest remaining workload, complementing the progress made with least_work_remaining_66c9 in the previous round.

---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Try different heuristics for better result.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
running steps: 15
hype parameter(optional): None
explanation: Given the current state data, the solution appears to have some inefficiencies in operation ordering, as evidenced by the high standard deviation in machine completion times (121.72) and average idle time per machine (197.0). Applying the `_2opt` heuristic can help fine-tune the solution by optimizing the operation order locally. Running it for 15 steps is reasonable to explore improvements while avoiding excessive computational effort.
