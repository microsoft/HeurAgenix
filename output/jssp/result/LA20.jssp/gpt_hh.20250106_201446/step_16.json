                "text": "Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). Below is an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios they are best suited for, along with possible quantifiable metrics for determining their applicability:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `first_come_first_served_6c4f`**\n- **Scenario**: \n  - This heuristic is most applicable when job arrival order is predetermined or prioritized externally (e.g., real-time scheduling where jobs arrive dynamically).\n  - Useful in systems where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over efficiency.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High job arrival frequency (dynamic scheduling).\n  - Low variance in processing times across jobs and machines.\n\n---\n\n### **2. `least_work_remaining_66c9`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Suitable when minimizing total workload (makespan) is critical.\n  - Effective when the remaining workload across jobs varies significantly.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High variance in total processing times across jobs (`std_dev(job_remaining_times)`).\n  - High average remaining workload across unfinished jobs (`mean(job_remaining_times)`).\n\n---\n\n### **3. `longest_job_next_2e23`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Useful when prioritizing jobs with the longest workload to avoid leaving them unfinished toward the end.\n  - Can help balance makespan by addressing \"bottleneck\" jobs early.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High variance in total processing times across jobs (`std_dev(job_remaining_times)`).\n  - Large number of jobs with significantly higher workloads than others (`max(job_remaining_times)` > `threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **4. `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Effective when the longest individual operations dominate the schedule and create bottlenecks on certain machines.\n  - Suitable for balancing machine workloads.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High variance in operation times across machines (`std_dev(operation_times)`).\n  - Machines with disproportionately long operation times (`max(operation_times)` > `threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **5. `most_work_remaining_930e`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Similar to `longest_job_next`, but focuses on jobs with the maximum total workload rather than the longest individual operations.\n  - Best for reducing overall makespan in cases of high workload imbalance across jobs.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High variance in total workload across jobs (`std_dev(job_total_workload)`).\n  - High number of unfinished jobs with significant workloads (`unfinished_jobs > threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **6. `random_6512`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Useful for generating diverse solutions or exploring new parts of the solution space (e.g., in combination with metaheuristics like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms).\n  - Effective for breaking out of local optima.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - Stagnation in solution quality improvement over iterations (`iteration_quality_change < epsilon`).\n  - High diversity required in solution space exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **7. `shift_operator_109f`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Applicable for fine-tuning solutions by rearranging operations within the same machine.\n  - Best used when most jobs are already scheduled, and small adjustments can significantly impact the makespan.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - Near-optimal solutions with minor inefficiencies (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan < threshold`).\n  - High variance in operation sequences within machines (`std_dev(machine_job_sequences)`).\n\n---\n\n### **8. `shortest_job_next_5b42`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Ideal for minimizing waiting times for short jobs, especially when there are many short jobs with small workloads.\n  - Effective in scenarios where fairness or minimizing job lateness is prioritized.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High number of short jobs relative to the total (`mean(job_remaining_times) < threshold`).\n  - High variance in job processing times (`std_dev(job_processing_times)`).\n\n---\n\n### **9. `shortest_processing_time_first_c374`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Suitable for minimizing idle time on machines by scheduling the shortest operations first.\n  - Best for reducing machine-level bottlenecks.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - High variance in operation times across machines (`std_dev(operation_times)`).\n  - Significant number of short operations across jobs (`mean(operation_times) < threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **10. `_2opt_f9c1`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Effective for local optimization by swapping two operations and reducing makespan.\n  - Best used when the solution is near-optimal but contains small inefficiencies due to poor operation order.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - Near-optimal solutions (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan < threshold`).\n  - High potential for improvement in operation ordering (`operation_ordering_score < threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **11. `_3opt_6ee0`**\n- **Scenario**:\n  - Suitable for more aggressive local optimization, allowing exploration of a broader set of operation rearrangements.\n  - Effective when `_2opt` is insufficient for achieving significant improvements in makespan.\n- **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n  - Moderate-to-high suboptimality in solutions (`current_makespan - best_known_makespan > threshold`).\n  - High potential for improvement in operation ordering (`operation_ordering_score < threshold`).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nTo quantify the scenarios for applying these heuristics, the following metrics can be used:\n1. **Variance in Job and Operation Times**: High variance suggests prioritization-based heuristics (e.g., `least_work_remaining`, `longest_processing_time_first`) might be effective.\n2. **Makespan Suboptimality**: Low suboptimality favors local optimization heuristics (`_2opt`, `_3opt`, `shift_operator`).\n3. **Diversity Needs**: Stagnation or lack of diversity in solutions suggests random heuristics (`random`) or exploratory methods.\n4. **System Characteristics**: Dynamic systems with real-time job arrival favor simple heuristics like `first_come_first_served`.\n\nEach heuristic has distinct strengths, and selecting the right one depends on the current state of the solution and problem characteristics."

Although `_2opt_f9c1` has been applied in the previous round and resulted in a reduction in makespan (-148), there may still be room for improvement.

Applying `_2opt_f9c1` can help optimize the operation order locally and reduce makespan further. Running it for 15 steps is a reasonable exploration of potential improvements.\nDelta of current_makespan: -49\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state data, there is still a significant number of unfinished jobs (9) with varying workloads. The high standard deviation in job completion times (152.23) and machine completion times (156.25) indicates potential imbalances in scheduling. The `least_work_remaining_66c9` heuristic is well-suited for addressing these imbalances by prioritizing jobs with the smallest remaining workload, helping to advance unfinished jobs and potentially reduce the makespan. Running it for 10 steps will provide a balanced approach to improving the solution without excessive computation.\nDelta of current_makespan: 386\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 2\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, although the previous application of `least_work_remaining_66c9` resulted in a significant increase in makespan (+386), it also advanced 2 jobs to completion and 10 operations. The high proportion of unfinished jobs (0.7) and the high standard deviation in job completion times (310.16) suggest that further balancing of workloads is necessary. Running this heuristic for another 10 steps could help address workload imbalances across unfinished jobs while monitoring its impact on makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 299\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state data indicates inefficiencies in operation ordering, as evidenced by the high standard deviation in job completion times (417.41) and machine completion times (191.10). Additionally, the high average idle time per machine (235.8) suggests that further local optimization could yield improvements in makespan. The `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic is well-suited for addressing these inefficiencies by optimizing the operation order locally. Running it for 15 steps allows for a focused exploration of potential improvements while avoiding excessive computational costs.\nDelta of current_makespan: -334\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the high standard deviation in operation times (27.46) and the presence of unfinished jobs (6), focusing on the longest next operation can help address bottlenecks caused by jobs with disproportionately long operations. This heuristic complements the `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic applied in the previous round by targeting specific long operations that could improve the overall balance and potentially reduce the makespan further. Running it for 10 steps ensures sufficient exploration without excessive computation.\nDelta of current_makespan: 295\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state data indicates inefficiencies in operation ordering, as evidenced by the high standard deviation in job completion times (417.41) and machine completion times (191.10). The high average idle time per machine (235.8) suggests that further local optimization could yield improvements in makespan. The `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic has previously demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing makespan (-334 in the last application). Running it for 15 more steps allows for focused local optimization to further refine the solution.\nDelta of current_makespan: -232\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The recent applications of `_2opt_f9c1` have consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing the makespan (-334 and -232 in the last two applications), addressing inefficiencies in operation ordering. The current state still shows high standard deviations in job completion times (206.22) and machine completion times (163.06), along with a significant average idle time per machine (190.0). These indicators suggest that further local optimization via `_2opt_f9c1` could yield additional improvements in makespan. Running it for another 15 steps is a reasonable continuation to refine the solution further.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 14---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The recent applications of `_2opt_f9c1` have consistently shown improvements in reducing makespan (-334 and -232) by addressing inefficiencies in operation ordering. The current state still exhibits high standard deviations in job completion times (206.22) and machine completion times (163.06), along with a significant average idle time per machine (190.0). These indicators suggest room for further local optimization. Continuing with `_2opt_f9c1` for another 15 steps ensures focused refinement of the solution while leveraging its proven effectiveness in this context.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 15---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state data indicates a significant proportion of unfinished jobs (0.6) and high standard deviation in job completion times (206.22). Applying `least_work_remaining_66c9` can help balance workloads across unfinished jobs and potentially advance more jobs to completion. This heuristic has shown effectiveness in addressing workload imbalances in previous rounds and complements the `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic applied earlier for local optimization. Running for 10 steps allows for steady progress without excessive computational effort.\nDelta of current_makespan: 256\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 2\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: least_work_remaining_66c9. How does least_work_remaining_66c9 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nTry different heuristics for better result.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
