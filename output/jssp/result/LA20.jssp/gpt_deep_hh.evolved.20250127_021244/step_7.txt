I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making a series of decisions to optimize scheduling, which is a typical characteristic of combinatorial problems. The use of heuristic algorithms is a common approach to solve such problems, given their complexity and the need for efficient solutions. Your framework, including the Solution and Operator classes, seems aligned with the requirements for addressing a combinatorial operation problem like JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): dynamic_priority,remaining_work,processing_time,local_optimization,simple_priority

dynamic_priority: These heuristics use dynamic scoring mechanisms to adaptively prioritize jobs based on factors like machine availability and job alignment with the solution trajectory.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.

remaining_work: These heuristics evaluate jobs based on the amount of work remaining, either choosing the job with the most work remaining or the least.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.

processing_time: These heuristics focus on the processing time of operations, either prioritizing the shortest or the longest processing time.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_optimization: These heuristics attempt to improve the schedule through local changes like swaps or shifts to reduce makespan.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

simple_priority: These heuristics use a straightforward priority mechanism based on job length or processing time.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:10
job_operation_sequence:[[6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0, 5, 9, 7], [7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6], [2, 5, 0, 3, 1, 6, 4, 8, 7, 9], [4, 6, 7, 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 8], [0, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 5, 7], [2, 6, 3, 5, 1, 8, 0, 9, 4, 7], [4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 2], [1, 7, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 0, 2, 5], [3, 8, 0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 9, 7, 6], [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 7, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[9, 81, 55, 40, 32, 37, 6, 19, 81, 40], [21, 70, 65, 64, 46, 65, 25, 77, 55, 15], [85, 37, 40, 24, 44, 83, 89, 31, 84, 29], [80, 77, 56, 8, 30, 59, 38, 80, 41, 97], [91, 40, 88, 17, 71, 50, 59, 80, 56, 7], [8, 9, 58, 77, 29, 96, 45, 10, 54, 36], [70, 92, 98, 87, 99, 27, 86, 96, 28, 73], [95, 92, 85, 52, 81, 32, 39, 59, 41, 56], [60, 45, 88, 12, 7, 22, 93, 49, 69, 27], [21, 61, 68, 26, 82, 71, 44, 99, 33, 84]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To effectively navigate the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and optimize the solution using heuristics, a strategic guide can be structured around two main phases: the Construction Phase and the Improvement Phase. Here's a framework for selecting heuristic categories and execution steps during each phase:

### Construction Phase

The Construction Phase involves creating an initial feasible solution. This solution doesn't have to be optimal, but it should provide a good starting point for further refinement. The focus here is on quickly establishing a viable schedule.

1. **Dynamic Priority Heuristics:**
   - **Purpose:** Quickly adapt to the problem's constraints and the current solution trajectory.
   - **Execution Steps:** Start with a heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish an initial schedule. Evaluate its effectiveness in terms of makespan and resource allocation.
   - **Switching Strategy:** If the initial heuristic does not perform well, switch to another dynamic heuristic such as `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to see if it provides better alignment with machine availability.

2. **Simple Priority Heuristics:**
   - **Purpose:** Provide straightforward rules to establish a baseline solution.
   - **Execution Steps:** Use `shortest_job_next_5b42` to quickly prioritize jobs with the least processing time. Evaluate the makespan and adjust if necessary.
   - **Switching Strategy:** If results are unsatisfactory, try `longest_job_next_2e23` to see if it better balances machine load and job completion times.

### Improvement Phase

Once an initial solution is constructed, the Improvement Phase focuses on optimizing the schedule by reducing the makespan and improving resource utilization.

1. **Remaining Work Heuristics:**
   - **Purpose:** Focus on jobs with significant remaining work to balance the workload across machines.
   - **Execution Steps:** Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` to see if focusing on jobs with more remaining work can reduce overall makespan.
   - **Switching Strategy:** If this does not yield improvements, switch to `least_work_remaining_66c9` for a different perspective on remaining work.

2. **Processing Time Heuristics:**
   - **Purpose:** Optimize the schedule by focusing on operation processing times.
   - **Execution Steps:** Try `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to prioritize operations that can quickly be completed, then evaluate performance.
   - **Switching Strategy:** If necessary, switch to `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` to test whether focusing on longer operations provides better results.

3. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**
   - **Purpose:** Fine-tune the solution by making local changes to the schedule.
   - **Execution Steps:** Use `_2opt_f9c1` to test small swaps in the schedule for potential improvements.
   - **Switching Strategy:** If the improvement is marginal, try `_3opt_6ee0` for more complex adjustments or `shift_operator_109f` to experiment with shifting operations.

### Iterative Approach

- **Evaluation and Feedback:** After each heuristic application, evaluate the solution's performance based on makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.
- **Adaptive Switching:** Use the evaluation results to decide whether to continue with the current heuristic category or switch to another. Aim for a balance between exploration (trying new heuristics) and exploitation (refining the current solution).
- **Experimentation:** Periodically test different combinations of heuristics to discover synergistic effects that may not be apparent when heuristics are used in isolation.

By following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore and refine solutions for the JSSP, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories during both the Construction and Improvement Phases. This iterative and adaptive approach will help in identifying the most effective strategies for different problem instances.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
job_num:10
machine_num:10
job_operation_sequence:[[6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0, 5, 9, 7], [7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6], [2, 5, 0, 3, 1, 6, 4, 8, 7, 9], [4, 6, 7, 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 8], [0, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 5, 7], [2, 6, 3, 5, 1, 8, 0, 9, 4, 7], [4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 2], [1, 7, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 0, 2, 5], [3, 8, 0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 9, 7, 6], [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 7, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[9, 81, 55, 40, 32, 37, 6, 19, 81, 40], [21, 70, 65, 64, 46, 65, 25, 77, 55, 15], [85, 37, 40, 24, 44, 83, 89, 31, 84, 29], [80, 77, 56, 8, 30, 59, 38, 80, 41, 97], [91, 40, 88, 17, 71, 50, 59, 80, 56, 7], [8, 9, 58, 77, 29, 96, 45, 10, 54, 36], [70, 92, 98, 87, 99, 27, 86, 96, 28, 73], [95, 92, 85, 52, 81, 32, 39, 59, 41, 56], [60, 45, 88, 12, 7, 22, 93, 49, 69, 27], [21, 61, 68, 26, 82, 71, 44, 99, 33, 84]]

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: dynamic_priority
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since no heuristic has been applied yet, starting with a dynamic_priority heuristic is advisable. This category will adaptively prioritize jobs based on the current state, machine availability, and alignment with potential solution trajectories. It offers flexibility in establishing an initial schedule that can be further refined in subsequent phases.
current_makespan: 0->9
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: remaining_work
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Since the initial heuristic focused on dynamically prioritizing jobs with the shortest processing time, it's beneficial to switch to a category that considers the overall workload balance. The "remaining_work" category can provide insight into jobs that may contribute significantly to the makespan if not addressed. By focusing on either the most or least work remaining, we can develop a more balanced schedule and potentially reduce the makespan more effectively at this early stage of solution development.
current_makespan: 9->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: processing_time
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the current makespan has increased significantly, it's important to focus on optimizing the schedule by considering the processing times of operations. Switching to the "processing_time" category can help prioritize operations that either minimize or balance the processing time across machines. By focusing on either the shortest or longest processing times, we can further refine the schedule and potentially reduce the makespan more effectively. This approach will also help balance machine loads and improve overall efficiency.
current_makespan: 90->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain: At this stage, after applying several heuristics focused on different aspects of the problem, the makespan remains unchanged, indicating that local adjustments might be necessary to improve the schedule. Switching to the "local_optimization" category can help fine-tune the solution by making localized changes such as swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan. This approach will allow us to explore potential improvements in the current schedule that might not be achievable through global heuristics alone.
current_makespan: 90->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->3
---Round 4---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: remaining_work
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the current makespan has not improved with the last local optimization attempt, it may be beneficial to switch back to a heuristic category that focuses on balancing the workload. The remaining_work category can help identify jobs that might disproportionately affect the makespan if not prioritized. By evaluating jobs based on the remaining work, we might achieve a more balanced schedule that can reduce the makespan and improve overall efficiency.
current_makespan: 90->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->4
---Round 5---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the longest_job_next heuristic from the remaining_work category was recently applied and the makespan remains unchanged, it's a sign that a global workload balance is not effectively reducing the makespan. Switching to local_optimization can help make targeted adjustments, such as swaps or shifts, to potentially reduce the makespan. Local optimization strategies are particularly useful when global heuristics stall, as they can uncover small, impactful changes that improve the schedule.
current_makespan: 90->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->4
---Round 6---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: dynamic_priority
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the makespan has remained unchanged for several rounds despite using local optimization strategies, it might be beneficial to switch to a dynamic priority heuristic. This category can adaptively prioritize jobs based on current machine availability and job trajectory, which may help in breaking the stagnation by introducing more flexibility into the scheduling process. By leveraging dynamic scoring, we can potentially identify operations that can be scheduled in a way that reduces the current makespan and balances resource utilization more effectively.
current_makespan: 90->90
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->5

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: first_come_first_served_af26(dynamic_priority). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: dynamic_priority,remaining_work,processing_time,local_optimization,simple_priority

explanation: Given the current state where the makespan has not improved after several rounds, a more focused approach on local changes might help break the stagnation. Local optimization allows for targeted adjustments that can uncover small but impactful improvements in the schedule. Since the proportion of unfinished jobs is still high, exploring potential schedule refinements through swaps or shifts could lead to a reduction in makespan and better resource utilization.
