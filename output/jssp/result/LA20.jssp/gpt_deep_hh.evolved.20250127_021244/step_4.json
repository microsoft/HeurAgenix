In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine.

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP.

Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "To effectively navigate the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and optimize the solution using heuristics, a strategic guide can be structured around two main phases: the Construction Phase and the Improvement Phase. Here's a framework for selecting heuristic categories and execution steps during each phase:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\nThe Construction Phase involves creating an initial feasible solution. This solution doesn't have to be optimal, but it should provide a good starting point for further refinement. The focus here is on quickly establishing a viable schedule.\n\n1. **Dynamic Priority Heuristics:**\n   - **Purpose:** Quickly adapt to the problem's constraints and the current solution trajectory.\n   - **Execution Steps:** Start with a heuristic like `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish an initial schedule. Evaluate its effectiveness in terms of makespan and resource allocation.\n   - **Switching Strategy:** If the initial heuristic does not perform well, switch to another dynamic heuristic such as `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to see if it provides better alignment with machine availability.\n\n2. **Simple Priority Heuristics:**\n   - **Purpose:** Provide straightforward rules to establish a baseline solution.\n   - **Execution Steps:** Use `shortest_job_next_5b42` to quickly prioritize jobs with the least processing time. Evaluate the makespan and adjust if necessary.\n   - **Switching Strategy:** If results are unsatisfactory, try `longest_job_next_2e23` to see if it better balances machine load and job completion times.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\nOnce an initial solution is constructed, the Improvement Phase focuses on optimizing the schedule by reducing the makespan and improving resource utilization.\n\n1. **Remaining Work Heuristics:**\n   - **Purpose:** Focus on jobs with significant remaining work to balance the workload across machines.\n   - **Execution Steps:** Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` to see if focusing on jobs with more remaining work can reduce overall makespan.\n   - **Switching Strategy:** If this does not yield improvements, switch to `least_work_remaining_66c9` for a different perspective on remaining work.\n\n2. **Processing Time Heuristics:**\n   - **Purpose:** Optimize the schedule by focusing on operation processing times.\n   - **Execution Steps:** Try `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to prioritize operations that can quickly be completed, then evaluate performance.\n   - **Switching Strategy:** If necessary, switch to `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` to test whether focusing on longer operations provides better results.\n\n3. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n   - **Purpose:** Fine-tune the solution by making local changes to the schedule.\n   - **Execution Steps:** Use `_2opt_f9c1` to test small swaps in the schedule for potential improvements.\n   - **Switching Strategy:** If the improvement is marginal, try `_3opt_6ee0` for more complex adjustments or `shift_operator_109f` to experiment with shifting operations.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n\n- **Evaluation and Feedback:** After each heuristic application, evaluate the solution's performance based on makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.\n- **Adaptive Switching:** Use the evaluation results to decide whether to continue with the current heuristic category or switch to another. Aim for a balance between exploration (trying new heuristics) and exploitation (refining the current solution).\n- **Experimentation:** Periodically test different combinations of heuristics to discover synergistic effects that may not be apparent when heuristics are used in isolation.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore and refine solutions for the JSSP, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories during both the Construction and Improvement Phases. This iterative and adaptive approach will help in identifying the most effective strategies for different problem instances."

This category will adaptively prioritize jobs based on the current state, machine availability, and alignment with potential solution trajectories. It offers flexibility in establishing an initial schedule that can be further refined in subsequent phases.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->9\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nHeuristic Category: remaining_work\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the initial heuristic focused on dynamically prioritizing jobs with the shortest processing time, it's beneficial to switch to a category that considers the overall workload balance. The \"remaining_work\" category can provide insight into jobs that may contribute significantly to the makespan if not addressed. By focusing on either the most or least work remaining, we can develop a more balanced schedule and potentially reduce the makespan more effectively at this early stage of solution development.\ncurrent_makespan: 9->90\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nHeuristic Category: processing_time\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the current makespan has increased significantly, it's important to focus on optimizing the schedule by considering the processing times of operations. Switching to the \"processing_time\" category can help prioritize operations that either minimize or balance the processing time across machines. By focusing on either the shortest or longest processing times, we can further refine the schedule and potentially reduce the makespan more effectively. This approach will also help balance machine loads and improve overall efficiency.\ncurrent_makespan: 90->90\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: At this stage, after applying several heuristics focused on different aspects of the problem, the makespan remains unchanged, indicating that local adjustments might be necessary to improve the schedule. Switching to the \"local_optimization\" category can help fine-tune the solution by making localized changes such as swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan.
