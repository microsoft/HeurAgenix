in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

The `least_work_remaining` heuristic is well-suited for early stages of solution construction because it prioritizes jobs with the smallest remaining processing times, which helps balance the workload and avoid bottlenecks later. Running this heuristic for 10 steps will allow us to observe how it distributes the initial workload across machines.\nDelta of current_makespan: 400\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: At this stage, the `shortest_processing_time_first` heuristic is a good candidate to complement the workload distribution achieved by the previous `least_work_remaining` heuristic. By prioritizing operations with the shortest processing times, this heuristic can help reduce machine idle times and improve the current makespan. Running it for 10 steps will allow for fine-tuning the schedule and potentially reducing bottlenecks caused by longer operations.\nDelta of current_makespan: 66\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: At this stage, the `shortest_processing_time_first` heuristic has already reduced makespan by focusing on shorter operations. However, the current makespan (466) still exhibits potential for improvement. To complement the previous heuristic, the `longest_processing_time_first` heuristic can now address bottlenecks caused by long-duration operations that may delay the schedule's overall progress. By prioritizing longer operations, this heuristic can help balance machine workloads and reduce idle time, potentially improving the overall makespan and utilization efficiency.\nDelta of current_makespan: 159\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current makespan (466) and the distribution of operations suggest that there is potential to improve the schedule further. Since the last heuristic addressed long-duration operations (`longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`), it is now beneficial to re-balance the workload by focusing on jobs with the least remaining work. This will help avoid bottlenecks and improve the progression of unfinished jobs. Running `least_work_remaining` for 10 steps can contribute to a more balanced solution and potentially reduce the makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 245\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The last application of `least_work_remaining_66c9` showed significant improvements in makespan (-245), finished job count (+1), and finished operation count (+10). This indicates that the heuristic is effective at this stage in advancing the solution and balancing the workload among unfinished jobs. Continuing with it for another 10 steps will likely further reduce the makespan while progressing unfinished jobs closer to completion. This heuristic is particularly suited for the current state, where there is a high proportion of unfinished jobs (80%) and opportunities to optimize job progression.\nDelta of current_makespan: 396\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 2\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds, particularly using `least_work_remaining_66c9`, have made significant progress in reducing the makespan and advancing unfinished jobs. However, there is still a high proportion of unfinished jobs (60%) and opportunities to optimize their progression. At this stage, the `shortest_job_next_5b42` heuristic is well-suited to further reduce job completion times by prioritizing unfinished jobs with the shortest remaining processing times. This can help clear smaller jobs and balance the workload for subsequent steps, further improving the makespan and overall schedule efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to observe its impact in complementing the previous heuristics.\nDelta of current_makespan: 324\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state still shows a high proportion of unfinished jobs (50%) and a need to further optimize the makespan. The `least_work_remaining` heuristic has historically demonstrated strong performance in balancing workloads and advancing unfinished jobs. Given the previous improvements in makespan (-396 in Round 4 and -245 in Round 0) and the current state of unfinished jobs, applying this heuristic for another 10 steps is expected to further reduce the makespan and advance job progression effectively.\nDelta of current_makespan: 327\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state data shows that the makespan (1917) and the high average idle time per machine (258.5) indicate potential inefficiencies in machine utilization. While `least_work_remaining_66c9` has historically performed well, the next logical step is to address machine idle times and improve the schedule by prioritizing operations with the shortest processing times. This will help reduce idle time and refine the current makespan further. Running `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` for 10 steps is expected to complement the progress made in previous rounds and improve the overall efficiency of the schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 301\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows a makespan of 2218, with 4 unfinished jobs (40%) and a significant opportunity for further optimization. The `least_work_remaining` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in advancing unfinished jobs and balancing workloads. It is particularly effective at this stage, where focusing on jobs with the smallest remaining workloads can help reduce bottlenecks and improve the makespan. Given the historical success of this heuristic in similar scenarios, applying it for 10 steps is a logical next step to continue improving the solution.\nDelta of current_makespan: 245\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 2\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `least_work_remaining_66c9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in reducing the makespan and advancing unfinished jobs in previous rounds. With only two jobs remaining unfinished and significant progress made in prior iterations, this heuristic is well-suited to further balance the workload and optimize the schedule. Additionally, the historical improvements in makespan (-245 in Round 8 and -327 in Round 6) indicate its effectiveness in the current state. Running it for another 10 steps is expected to yield further reductions in the makespan while progressing the remaining unfinished jobs closer to completion.\nDelta of current_makespan: 496\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 2\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that the makespan (2959) is still high, and the average idle time per machine (332.4) indicates inefficiencies in machine utilization. While `least_work_remaining_66c9` has been effective in balancing workloads and advancing unfinished jobs, further improvements can be achieved by addressing machine idle times. The `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` heuristic is well-suited at this stage to minimize idle time by prioritizing operations with the shortest processing times, which can refine the current makespan and improve overall schedule efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will complement the progress made in previous rounds and focus on optimizing machine usage.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current makespan remains stagnant at 2959 after applying `shortest_processing_time_first_c374`, indicating that further reductions in makespan are unlikely with this heuristic. Given that the solution is already complete (all jobs and operations are finished), the next logical step is to refine the schedule and minimize the makespan further. The `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic is well-suited for this task as it focuses on swapping two non-adjacent operations to reduce the makespan. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to explore potential improvements without drastically altering the schedule structure.\nDelta of current_makespan: -532\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic demonstrated its ability to improve the current solution by reducing the makespan by 532 in the previous round. Given that the solution is already complete (all jobs and operations are finished), the primary focus is now on refining the schedule to further minimize the makespan. The `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it explores potential improvements through pairwise swaps, which can yield incremental benefits without drastically altering the solution structure. Running it for another 10 steps will help evaluate whether additional reductions in makespan can be achieved.\nDelta of current_makespan: -666\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The last two rounds of applying `_2opt_f9c1` have demonstrated significant improvements in reducing the makespan (-532 in Round 11 and -666 in Round 12). This indicates that the heuristic is effective at refining the current solution. Since the solution is already complete (all jobs and operations are finished), the primary focus remains on further minimizing the makespan. Continuing with `_2opt_f9c1` for another 10 steps will allow us to explore additional incremental improvements and determine whether further reductions in makespan are achievable.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: _2opt_f9c1. How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nTry different heuristics for better result.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
