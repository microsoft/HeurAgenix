I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

***is_cop:yes***  

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding an optimal arrangement of discrete elements (jobs and their operations) under specific constraints to minimize or maximize an objective function (e.g., minimizing makespan). The use of heuristics is well-suited for this type of problem because exact methods often become computationally expensive as the problem size increases.  

The framework you have outlined (Solution and Operator) aligns with the principles of combinatorial optimization and hyper-heuristics. The operators you've implemented (e.g., AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, etc.) are typical modifications applied to solutions in such problems, and the standardized heuristic function interface you described is a good way to enable flexible and reusable heuristic strategies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Before this discuss, we have already 9 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: At this stage, all jobs are unfinished, and there is no partial solution constructed yet. The `least_work_remaining` heuristic is well-suited for early stages of solution construction because it prioritizes jobs with the smallest remaining processing times, which helps balance the workload and avoid bottlenecks later. Running this heuristic for 10 steps will allow us to observe how it distributes the initial workload across machines.
Delta of current_makespan: 400
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: At this stage, the `shortest_processing_time_first` heuristic is a good candidate to complement the workload distribution achieved by the previous `least_work_remaining` heuristic. By prioritizing operations with the shortest processing times, this heuristic can help reduce machine idle times and improve the current makespan. Running it for 10 steps will allow for fine-tuning the schedule and potentially reducing bottlenecks caused by longer operations.
Delta of current_makespan: 66
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: At this stage, the `shortest_processing_time_first` heuristic has already reduced makespan by focusing on shorter operations. However, the current makespan (466) still exhibits potential for improvement. To complement the previous heuristic, the `longest_processing_time_first` heuristic can now address bottlenecks caused by long-duration operations that may delay the schedule's overall progress. By prioritizing longer operations, this heuristic can help balance machine workloads and reduce idle time, potentially improving the overall makespan and utilization efficiency.
Delta of current_makespan: 159
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 3---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current makespan (466) and the distribution of operations suggest that there is potential to improve the schedule further. Since the last heuristic addressed long-duration operations (`longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`), it is now beneficial to re-balance the workload by focusing on jobs with the least remaining work. This will help avoid bottlenecks and improve the progression of unfinished jobs. Running `least_work_remaining` for 10 steps can contribute to a more balanced solution and potentially reduce the makespan.
Delta of current_makespan: 245
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 4---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The last application of `least_work_remaining_66c9` showed significant improvements in makespan (-245), finished job count (+1), and finished operation count (+10). This indicates that the heuristic is effective at this stage in advancing the solution and balancing the workload among unfinished jobs. Continuing with it for another 10 steps will likely further reduce the makespan while progressing unfinished jobs closer to completion. This heuristic is particularly suited for the current state, where there is a high proportion of unfinished jobs (80%) and opportunities to optimize job progression.

---Round 5---
Heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous rounds, particularly using `least_work_remaining_66c9`, have made significant progress in reducing the makespan and advancing unfinished jobs. However, there is still a high proportion of unfinished jobs (60%) and opportunities to optimize their progression. At this stage, the `shortest_job_next_5b42` heuristic is well-suited to further reduce job completion times by prioritizing unfinished jobs with the shortest remaining processing times. This can help clear smaller jobs and balance the workload for subsequent steps, further improving the makespan and overall schedule efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to observe its impact in complementing the previous heuristics.

Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 6---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state still shows a high proportion of unfinished jobs (50%) and a need to further optimize the makespan. The `least_work_remaining` heuristic has historically demonstrated strong performance in balancing workloads and advancing unfinished jobs. Given the previous improvements in makespan (-396 in Round 4 and -245 in Round 0) and the current state of unfinished jobs, applying this heuristic for another 10 steps is expected to further reduce the makespan and advance job progression effectively.
Delta of current_makespan: 327
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 7---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state data shows that the makespan (1917) and the high average idle time per machine (258.5) indicate potential inefficiencies in machine utilization. While `least_work_remaining_66c9` has historically performed well, the next logical step is to address machine idle times and improve the schedule by prioritizing operations with the shortest processing times. This will help reduce idle time and refine the current makespan further. Running `shortest_processing_time_first_c374` for 10 steps is expected to complement the progress made in previous rounds and improve the overall efficiency of the schedule.
Delta of current_makespan: 301
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 8---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows a makespan of 2218, with 4 unfinished jobs (40%) and a significant opportunity for further optimization. The `least_work_remaining` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in advancing unfinished jobs and balancing workloads. It is particularly effective at this stage, where focusing on jobs with the smallest remaining workloads can help reduce bottlenecks and improve the makespan. Given the historical success of this heuristic in similar scenarios, applying it for 10 steps is a logical next step to continue improving the solution.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: least_work_remaining_66c9. How does least_work_remaining_66c9 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Try different heuristics for better result.

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9  
running steps: 10  
hype parameter(optional): None  
explanation: The `least_work_remaining_66c9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in reducing the makespan and advancing unfinished jobs in previous rounds. With only two jobs remaining unfinished and significant progress made in prior iterations, this heuristic is well-suited to further balance the workload and optimize the schedule. Additionally, the historical improvements in makespan (-245 in Round 8 and -327 in Round 6) indicate its effectiveness in the current state. Running it for another 10 steps is expected to yield further reductions in the makespan while progressing the remaining unfinished jobs closer to completion.
