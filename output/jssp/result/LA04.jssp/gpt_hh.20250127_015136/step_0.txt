I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal schedule for a set of jobs with specific sequences of operations on a set of machines, which is a classic example of combinatorial optimization. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve JSSP because of its complexity and the fact that exact methods become impractical for large instances. Your framework involving solutions and operators is a suitable approach to address the JSSP using heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable involves understanding the specific characteristics and priorities of the scheduling environment. Here’s a brief analysis of when each heuristic might be most beneficial:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: Best used in environments where small adjustments to existing schedules can lead to significant improvements in efficiency. It’s applicable when the current schedule is close to optimal, and fine-tuning is needed to achieve the best performance.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where reducing job waiting times is critical. This heuristic minimizes the time jobs spend waiting to be processed, making it suitable for environments with high variability in job processing times and low tolerance for idle times.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful in complex scheduling environments where multiple operations need to be optimized concurrently. Although a complete 3-opt move isn't feasible in JSSP, using a series of 2-opt swaps can be beneficial in exploring alternative sequences for potential makespan reduction.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**: 
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where balancing workload across machines is a priority. By prioritizing the longest jobs, this heuristic aims to maximize resource utilization and prevent bottlenecks.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**: 
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for schedules that need significant restructuring. By swapping non-adjacent operations, this heuristic is effective in environments where the current schedule is suboptimal and requires substantial changes to reduce the makespan.

6. **random_6512**: 
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in highly dynamic environments where job priorities frequently change, or when a diverse set of solutions is needed to escape local optima. This heuristic can introduce variability and explore various scheduling possibilities.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**: 
   - **Scenario**: Best used in environments where it’s crucial to ensure jobs with significant remaining work are prioritized to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks. Suitable for systems where completing large jobs early is a strategic advantage.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where machine utilization is crucial, and it’s beneficial to keep machines busy with longer tasks to minimize idle times.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**: 
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where quick turnover of jobs is necessary, such as in just-in-time production systems. By focusing on jobs with the least remaining work, it helps in rapidly completing jobs and freeing up resources.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**: 
    - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments that prioritize reducing the average time jobs spend in the system. It’s effective in minimizing the overall job completion time and improving throughput.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**: 
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimization. It’s often used in service industries where jobs are handled in the order they arrive to ensure equitable treatment.

Each heuristic addresses different aspects of the scheduling problem, and their applicability largely depends on the specific operational goals and constraints of the environment. In practice, a combination of these heuristics might be used to achieve a balanced and efficient schedule.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N

2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374
running steps: 1
explanation: Given that all jobs are currently unfinished and the machine utilization is relatively high, starting with the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic can help quickly reduce idle times by addressing operations with the shortest processing times. This approach should help in efficiently initializing the schedule while minimizing the waiting times for shorter operations.
