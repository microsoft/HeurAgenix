The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

                "text": "Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable involves understanding the specific characteristics and priorities of the scheduling environment. Here\u2019s a brief analysis of when each heuristic might be most beneficial:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**: \n   - **Scenario**: Best used in environments where small adjustments to existing schedules can lead to significant improvements in efficiency. It\u2019s applicable when the current schedule is close to optimal, and fine-tuning is needed to achieve the best performance.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**: \n   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where reducing job waiting times is critical. This heuristic minimizes the time jobs spend waiting to be processed, making it suitable for environments with high variability in job processing times and low tolerance for idle times.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful in complex scheduling environments where multiple operations need to be optimized concurrently. Although a complete 3-opt move isn't feasible in JSSP, using a series of 2-opt swaps can be beneficial in exploring alternative sequences for potential makespan reduction.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**: \n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where balancing workload across machines is a priority. By prioritizing the longest jobs, this heuristic aims to maximize resource utilization and prevent bottlenecks.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**: \n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for schedules that need significant restructuring. By swapping non-adjacent operations, this heuristic is effective in environments where the current schedule is suboptimal and requires substantial changes to reduce the makespan.\n\n6. **random_6512**: \n   - **Scenario**: Applicable in highly dynamic environments where job priorities frequently change, or when a diverse set of solutions is needed to escape local optima. This heuristic can introduce variability and explore various scheduling possibilities.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**: \n   - **Scenario**: Best used in environments where it\u2019s crucial to ensure jobs with significant remaining work are prioritized to prevent them from becoming bottlenecks. Suitable for systems where completing large jobs early is a strategic advantage.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**: \n   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where machine utilization is crucial, and it\u2019s beneficial to keep machines busy with longer tasks to minimize idle times.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**: \n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where quick turnover of jobs is necessary, such as in just-in-time production systems. By focusing on jobs with the least remaining work, it helps in rapidly completing jobs and freeing up resources.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**: \n    - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments that prioritize reducing the average time jobs spend in the system. It\u2019s effective in minimizing the overall job completion time and improving throughput.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**: \n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized over optimization. It\u2019s often used in service industries where jobs are handled in the order they arrive to ensure equitable treatment.\n\nEach heuristic addresses different aspects of the scheduling problem, and their applicability largely depends on the specific operational goals and constraints of the environment. In practice, a combination of these heuristics might be used to achieve a balanced and efficient schedule."

How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
