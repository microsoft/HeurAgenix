This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\n\nLongestProcessingTime: Focuses on scheduling jobs with the longest processing time first to balance workload distribution across machines.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nMostWorkRemaining: Selects jobs with the most work remaining to reduce the potential for bottlenecks and improve overall completion time.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\n\nLeastWorkRemaining: Targets jobs with the least work remaining to quickly finish jobs and potentially free up resources for other tasks.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\n\nFirstComeFirstServed: Schedules jobs based on their arrival order, which can be useful in scenarios where job arrival times are critical.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\n\nLocalOptimization: Applies local optimization techniques to improve the current schedule by making small, beneficial changes to job sequences.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\n\nJobLengthBased: Uses the total remaining or longest job length as a criterion for scheduling, which can help manage job priorities effectively.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\njob_num:10\nmachine_num:5\njob_operation_sequence:[[0, 2, 3, 4, 1], [1, 3, 4, 2, 0], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 3, 1], [1, 3, 4, 0, 2], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1, 0]]\njob_operation_time:[[12, 94, 92, 91, 7], [19, 11, 66, 21, 87], [14, 75, 13, 16, 20], [95, 66, 7, 7, 77], [45, 6, 89, 15, 34], [77, 20, 76, 88, 53], [74, 88, 52, 27, 9], [88, 69, 62, 98, 52], [61, 9, 62, 52, 90], [54, 5, 59, 15, 88]]\ntotal_operation_num:50\naverage_operation_time:50.14\nmax_operation_time:98\nmin_operation_time:5\nstd_deviation_operation_time:32.00875505232904\njob_operation_time_range:93\naverage_job_length:5.0\nmax_job_length:5\nmin_job_length:5\nmachine_utilization:0.8\njob_diversity:5\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a framework to guide the selection and execution:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Construction Phase\nThe construction phase focuses on building an initial feasible solution. During this phase, the goal is to quickly generate a schedule that adheres to constraints, which can then be refined in the improvement phase.\n\n1. **Start with Diversified Construction Heuristics:**\n   - **FirstComeFirstServed (FCFS):** Begin with FCFS to set a baseline. This heuristic is straightforward and can help establish an initial sequence based on job arrival order.\n   - **ShortestProcessingTime / LongestProcessingTime:** Experiment with these to see how prioritizing jobs based on processing time affects the initial makespan. They help in understanding the impact of operation time distribution.\n\n2. **Evaluate Initial Solution Performance:**\n   - Use the makespan, total idle time, and machine utilization metrics to evaluate the performance of the initial solution.\n   - Transition to the improvement phase if the initial solution is feasible and provides a reasonable starting point.\n\n#### Improvement Phase\nThe improvement phase aims to refine the initial solution by reducing the makespan, minimizing idle time, and balancing machine workload.\n\n1. **Apply Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n   - **2-opt / 3-opt:** Use these to explore local changes that can significantly reduce makespan by reordering operations within machine queues.\n   - **ShiftOperator:** Evaluate shifts within a machine's queue to identify potential improvements in operation sequencing.\n\n2. **Explore Work Remaining Heuristics:**\n   - **MostWorkRemaining / LeastWorkRemaining:** These can be useful for addressing bottlenecks and optimizing job flow through the system. They can help balance workload distribution.\n\n3. **Iterate with Job Length-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **ShortestJobNext / LongestJobNext:** After some improvements, use these to fine-tune the schedule by focusing on job lengths, which can help in managing priorities effectively.\n\n4. **Alternate Between Heuristic Categories:**\n   - Regularly switch between different heuristics to prevent premature convergence and explore diverse solutions. This approach can help avoid local optima and find a more global solution.\n\n5. **Reassess and Iterate:**\n   - Continuously assess the solution's performance using key metrics, and iterate with different heuristic combinations if improvements stagnate.\n   - Revisit the construction phase briefly if necessary, to explore new initial solutions or different heuristic setups.\n\n### Execution Steps\n1. **Initialize with FCFS or ShortestProcessingTime.**\n2. **Evaluate initial performance and apply 2-opt or 3-opt for local improvements.**\n3. **Switch to MostWorkRemaining if bottlenecks are identified.**\n4. **Incorporate ShiftOperator to explore further local sequence optimizations.**\n5. **Iterate with ShortestJobNext to fine-tune based on job lengths.**\n6. **Regularly reassess and alternate heuristics to enhance exploration.**\n\nThis framework is designed to be flexible, allowing for experimentation with various heuristics and adapting based on solution performance. It encourages using a mix of strategies for both constructing and refining solutions, promoting a balanced exploration-exploitation approach to solving JSSP."
