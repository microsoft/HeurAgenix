This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\n\nLongestProcessingTime: Focuses on scheduling jobs with the longest processing time first to balance workload distribution across machines.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nMostWorkRemaining: Selects jobs with the most work remaining to reduce the potential for bottlenecks and improve overall completion time.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\n\nLeastWorkRemaining: Targets jobs with the least work remaining to quickly finish jobs and potentially free up resources for other tasks.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\n\nFirstComeFirstServed: Schedules jobs based on their arrival order, which can be useful in scenarios where job arrival times are critical.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\n\nLocalOptimization: Applies local optimization techniques to improve the current schedule by making small, beneficial changes to job sequences.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\n\nJobLengthBased: Uses the total remaining or longest job length as a criterion for scheduling, which can help manage job priorities effectively.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP.

It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\njob_num:10\nmachine_num:5\njob_operation_sequence:[[0, 2, 3, 4, 1], [1, 3, 4, 2, 0], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 3, 1], [1, 3, 4, 0, 2], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1, 0]]\njob_operation_time:[[12, 94, 92, 91, 7], [19, 11, 66, 21, 87], [14, 75, 13, 16, 20], [95, 66, 7, 7, 77], [45, 6, 89, 15, 34], [77, 20, 76, 88, 53], [74, 88, 52, 27, 9], [88, 69, 62, 98, 52], [61, 9, 62, 52, 90], [54, 5, 59, 15, 88]]\ntotal_operation_num:50\naverage_operation_time:50.14\nmax_operation_time:98\nmin_operation_time:5\nstd_deviation_operation_time:32.00875505232904\njob_operation_time_range:93\naverage_job_length:5.0\nmax_job_length:5\nmin_job_length:5\nmachine_utilization:0.8\njob_diversity:5\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a framework to guide the selection and execution:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Construction Phase\nThe construction phase focuses on building an initial feasible solution. During this phase, the goal is to quickly generate a schedule that adheres to constraints, which can then be refined in the improvement phase.\n\n1. **Start with Diversified Construction Heuristics:**\n   - **FirstComeFirstServed (FCFS):** Begin with FCFS to set a baseline. This heuristic is straightforward and can help establish an initial sequence based on job arrival order.\n   - **ShortestProcessingTime / LongestProcessingTime:** Experiment with these to see how prioritizing jobs based on processing time affects the initial makespan. They help in understanding the impact of operation time distribution.\n\n2. **Evaluate Initial Solution Performance:**\n   - Use the makespan, total idle time, and machine utilization metrics to evaluate the performance of the initial solution.\n   - Transition to the improvement phase if the initial solution is feasible and provides a reasonable starting point.\n\n#### Improvement Phase\nThe improvement phase aims to refine the initial solution by reducing the makespan, minimizing idle time, and balancing machine workload.\n\n1. **Apply Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n   - **2-opt / 3-opt:** Use these to explore local changes that can significantly reduce makespan by reordering operations within machine queues.\n   - **ShiftOperator:** Evaluate shifts within a machine's queue to identify potential improvements in operation sequencing.\n\n2. **Explore Work Remaining Heuristics:**\n   - **MostWorkRemaining / LeastWorkRemaining:** These can be useful for addressing bottlenecks and optimizing job flow through the system. They can help balance workload distribution.\n\n3. **Iterate with Job Length-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **ShortestJobNext / LongestJobNext:** After some improvements, use these to fine-tune the schedule by focusing on job lengths, which can help in managing priorities effectively.\n\n4. **Alternate Between Heuristic Categories:**\n   - Regularly switch between different heuristics to prevent premature convergence and explore diverse solutions. This approach can help avoid local optima and find a more global solution.\n\n5. **Reassess and Iterate:**\n   - Continuously assess the solution's performance using key metrics, and iterate with different heuristic combinations if improvements stagnate.\n   - Revisit the construction phase briefly if necessary, to explore new initial solutions or different heuristic setups.\n\n### Execution Steps\n1. **Initialize with FCFS or ShortestProcessingTime.**\n2. **Evaluate initial performance and apply 2-opt or 3-opt for local improvements.**\n3. **Switch to MostWorkRemaining if bottlenecks are identified.**\n4. **Incorporate ShiftOperator to explore further local sequence optimizations.**\n5. **Iterate with ShortestJobNext to fine-tune based on job lengths.**\n6. **Regularly reassess and alternate heuristics to enhance exploration.**\n\nThis framework is designed to be flexible, allowing for experimentation with various heuristics and adapting based on solution performance. It encourages using a mix of strategies for both constructing and refining solutions, promoting a balanced exploration-exploitation approach to solving JSSP."

This will allow us to quickly generate a baseline solution and set the stage for further improvement in subsequent phases. FCFS is useful for understanding how jobs will flow through the machines initially, without any complex prioritization. Once we have this initial solution, we can better evaluate and select other heuristics to refine and improve the schedule.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->12\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: ShortestProcessingTime\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given that we've initiated the scheduling with First Come First Served, transitioning to Shortest Processing Time can help reduce idle times and improve throughput. By focusing on the next operation with the shortest processing time, we can aim to minimize machine idle times and balance the workload more efficiently across the machines. This approach will help in creating a tighter initial schedule, setting a strong foundation for further optimization in subsequent phases.\ncurrent_makespan: 12->19\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: ShortestProcessingTime\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the initial steps have focused on establishing a baseline with First Come First Served and then reducing idle times using Shortest Processing Time, it is beneficial to continue with the ShortestProcessingTime category. This heuristic is still applicable as we have just begun to schedule operations, and further iterations could enhance machine utilization and decrease the makespan. Continuing with this category will allow us to refine the current solution by targeting operations that can quickly proceed, thereby maintaining a balanced workload across machines and reducing overall completion time. Once we observe diminishing returns from this heuristic, we can consider switching to another category, such as LocalOptimization, for further improvements.\ncurrent_makespan: 19->95\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: MostWorkRemaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since we have already established a baseline with First Come First Served and have utilized Shortest Processing Time to reduce idle times, it's now beneficial to switch strategies to address potential bottlenecks and balance workload distribution across machines. The Most Work Remaining heuristic can help identify jobs with the largest amount of work left, which could be causing these bottlenecks, and focus on advancing these jobs to improve overall system flow and reduce the makespan. This approach will provide a new perspective on the problem and could lead to substantial improvements in the schedule.\ncurrent_makespan: 95->95\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: LocalOptimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, where no jobs have been completed and the makespan has not improved in the last round, it suggests that the current approach might be encountering diminishing returns or potential bottlenecks. Switching to the LocalOptimization category can help refine the existing solution by exploring local changes that could reduce the makespan and improve the flow of jobs through the machines. Local optimization techniques, like 2-opt or shift operators, can help identify beneficial changes in the sequence of operations, potentially unlocking improvements that previous heuristics might have missed.\ncurrent_makespan: 95->95\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->4\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: MostWorkRemaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, where the makespan has not improved and no jobs have been completed, it suggests that the existing approach might not be effectively addressing potential bottlenecks or workload imbalances. By selecting the Most Work Remaining heuristic category, we can focus on advancing jobs with the largest amount of work left, which could help in redistributing the workload and potentially unlocking improvements in the schedule. This approach aims to tackle the unfinished jobs that could be causing delays, thereby improving the overall flow and reducing the makespan.\ncurrent_makespan: 95->96\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->5\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: LocalOptimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the makespan has only marginally increased and no jobs have been completed, it's important to explore local changes that could yield improvements. The LocalOptimization category can help identify small but impactful adjustments to the current sequence of operations. Techniques like 2-opt or shift operators might uncover potential improvements by reordering operations or optimizing sequences within machines, which could address existing bottlenecks and improve overall flow.\ncurrent_makespan: 96->96\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->5\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nHeuristic Category: LeastWorkRemaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, where no jobs have been completed and the makespan has not significantly improved, it might be beneficial to switch strategies. Using the Least Work Remaining heuristic could help focus on completing jobs with the least amount of work left. This approach might quickly free up resources and create opportunities for other operations, potentially leading to improvements in flow and a reduction in the makespan. By targeting jobs that can be completed quickly, we might be able to unlock more efficient scheduling possibilities and enhance overall system performance.\ncurrent_makespan: 96->117\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->6\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: MostWorkRemaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where no jobs have been completed and the makespan has increased, it indicates potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the scheduling sequence. Returning to the Most Work Remaining category can help address these issues by focusing on advancing jobs with significant work left, which could be contributing to the delays. This approach may help redistribute workload and unlock improvements in flow and overall system performance. By targeting jobs with the most work remaining, we aim to balance the schedule and reduce the makespan effectively.\ncurrent_makespan: 117->117\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->7\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nHeuristic Category: LocalOptimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution where the makespan has not improved and no jobs have been completed, it suggests that the existing approach might not effectively address potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks. The LocalOptimization category can help identify small but impactful adjustments to the current sequence of operations. Techniques like 2-opt or shift operators might uncover potential improvements by reordering operations or optimizing sequences within machines, which could address existing bottlenecks and improve overall flow. This category is well-suited for refining the current schedule and potentially unlocking improvements that previous heuristics might have missed.\ncurrent_makespan: 117->117\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 7->7\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: MostWorkRemaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, where no jobs have been completed and the makespan remains unchanged despite local optimization efforts, it indicates that potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies are still present. The Most Work Remaining heuristic can help address these issues by focusing on advancing jobs with significant work left, which may contribute to these delays. By targeting jobs that have the most work remaining, we can attempt to rebalance the workload and potentially unlock improvements in the schedule, reducing the makespan and enhancing overall system performance.\ncurrent_makespan: 117->117\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 7->8\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: LocalOptimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, where the makespan has remained unchanged despite attempts with Most Work Remaining, it suggests that potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks still exist.
