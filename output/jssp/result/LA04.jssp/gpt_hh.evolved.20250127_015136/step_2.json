In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Here is an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios in which they might be most beneficial:\n\n1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471()**: \n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in environments where minimizing makespan is crucial, and machine availability is a constraint. It is suitable for situations where operations with shorter processing times can be scheduled first to optimize resource utilization.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for cases where job operations have highly variable processing times and machine idle times need to be minimized.\n\n2. **first_come_first_served_af26()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for systems where jobs are processed in the order they arrive, and there's a need to dynamically adjust to varying datasets. It works well in environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for scenarios with relatively uniform job sizes and when the order of arrival significantly impacts scheduling.\n\n3. **most_work_remaining_df20()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in situations where prioritizing jobs with the most remaining work can lead to better load balancing and resource allocation.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in cases where there are significant differences in total job processing times and balancing workload is essential.\n\n4. **shift_operator_109f()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when fine-tuning a schedule to reduce makespan by optimizing the position of operations within a machine\u2019s queue. Useful in environments with minor adjustments needed for significant improvements.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for scenarios with existing schedules close to optimal, requiring small tweaks for enhancement.\n\n5. **_3opt_6ee0()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable for complex job shop problems where approximate optimization can yield better solutions.
