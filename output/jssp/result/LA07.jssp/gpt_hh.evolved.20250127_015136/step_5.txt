I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem that can be effectively addressed using heuristics. The framework you have described, which includes a Solution class and various operators, is structured to support heuristic algorithms to solve JSSP. Your use of operators to modify solutions aligns well with heuristic approaches, as these operators can be used to explore the solution space and improve scheduling efficiency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Certainly! Each heuristic algorithm for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) has its strengths and is best suited for particular scenarios based on the problem characteristics and objectives. Hereâs an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm might be most applicable:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) d471**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is effective when the goal is to minimize the makespan and there are a few jobs with significantly shorter processing times. It is useful in environments where shorter jobs can be completed quickly, freeing up resources for longer jobs.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when there is a high variance in job processing times and shorter jobs can be prioritized without causing excessive delays to longer jobs.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) af26**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for environments where fairness is prioritized, and jobs are required to be processed in the order they arrive. This heuristic works well when jobs have similar processing times and there is a steady stream of incoming jobs.
   - **Quantification**: Best when job arrival times are a significant factor and the processing times do not vary widely.

3. **Most Work Remaining df20**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful in scenarios where the objective is to minimize the total remaining workload and avoid bottlenecks by prioritizing jobs with the most work left.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when there is a need to focus on jobs with long remaining processing times to prevent them from becoming critical path blockers.

4. **Shift Operator 109f**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective in situations where minor adjustments can significantly improve the schedule. This is suitable for fine-tuning an existing schedule to reduce makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Best when the schedule is close to optimal, and small shifts can lead to noticeable improvements.

5. **3-opt 6ee0**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is beneficial when looking to make larger changes to the schedule to escape local optima. It is useful when the current schedule is suboptimal, and a series of swaps might lead to improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Best when the existing solution is far from optimal, and there is room for significant improvement through reordering.

6. **Longest Job Next 2e23**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where the longest jobs are prioritized to ensure they do not become bottlenecks later in the schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when there is a risk of long jobs delaying the completion of the schedule if not prioritized.

7. **2-opt f9c1**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful for iteratively improving a schedule by exploring local swaps. This heuristic is effective when the schedule needs incremental improvements through pairwise exchanges.
   - **Quantification**: Best when the schedule is moderately optimized, but there is potential for improvement through local adjustments.

8. **Random 6512**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for exploratory purposes or when seeking diverse solutions in a stochastic environment. It can be used as part of a broader heuristic search or metaheuristic algorithm.
   - **Quantification**: Best when diversity in solutions is needed, or as a baseline to compare against more systematic heuristics.

9. **Longest Processing Time First 9dc9**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective in environments where jobs with longer processing times need to be prioritized to prevent them from impacting the schedule's completion time.
   - **Quantification**: Best when there is a significant disparity in job processing times, and longer jobs need prioritization to avoid delays.

10. **Least Work Remaining 66c9**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where quickly finishing the smallest jobs is advantageous, allowing machines to become available sooner for other tasks.
    - **Quantification**: Best when there is an incentive to complete as many jobs as possible quickly, minimizing the number of unfinished jobs.

11. **Shortest Job Next 5b42**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when minimizing the total time jobs spend in the system is a priority, focusing on quickly completing shorter jobs.
    - **Quantification**: Best when job processing times are variable, and shorter jobs can be completed rapidly without significantly impacting longer jobs.

Each heuristic has its own strengths and can be selected based on the specific characteristics and requirements of the scheduling problem at hand.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: most_work_remaining_df20. How does most_work_remaining_df20 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
running steps: 10
hype parameter(optional): 
explanation: The "most_work_remaining_df20" heuristic has been effective in reducing the makespan in previous rounds and has contributed to completing additional jobs. Given the high proportion of unfinished jobs and the ongoing need to minimize makespan, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could further target jobs with significant remaining workload, potentially leading to more completions and a reduced makespan.
