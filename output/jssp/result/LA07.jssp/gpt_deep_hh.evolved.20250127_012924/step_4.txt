I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem and can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. Your framework, which includes a `Solution` class and various operators (such as `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, and `ShiftOperator`), is consistent with the requirements for solving JSSP using hyper-heuristics. The provided data structures and heuristic function signature are appropriately designed for implementing heuristic algorithms to tackle this problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,randomized,complexity_adaptive

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific metrics like processing time, work remaining, or job length, making them suitable for scenarios where job prioritization is crucial.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

local_optimization: these heuristics focus on local optimization techniques, such as shifting operations or performing 2-opt and 3-opt swaps, making them effective in scenarios where small adjustments can lead to significant improvements in the schedule.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.

randomized: this heuristic introduces randomness in job selection, which can be useful for escaping local optima but is generally less powerful due to its lack of strategic decision-making.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.

complexity_adaptive: these heuristics incorporate dynamic adjustments based on complexity measures like job diversity or iteration count, making them adaptable to different problem complexities and dataset characteristics.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:15
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[0, 4, 1, 3, 2], [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 0, 2, 1, 4], [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 0, 1, 3, 2], [4, 0, 1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3]]
job_operation_time:[[47, 57, 71, 96, 14], [75, 60, 22, 79, 65], [32, 33, 69, 31, 58], [44, 34, 51, 58, 47], [29, 44, 62, 17, 8], [15, 40, 97, 38, 66], [58, 39, 57, 20, 50], [57, 32, 87, 63, 21], [56, 84, 90, 85, 61], [15, 20, 67, 30, 70], [84, 82, 23, 45, 38], [50, 21, 18, 41, 29], [16, 52, 52, 38, 54], [37, 54, 57, 74, 62], [57, 61, 81, 30, 68]]
total_operation_num:75
average_operation_time:49.93333333333333
max_operation_time:97

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves recognizing the unique strengths of each heuristic category and knowing when to apply them. Here is a proposed guide that can be used to alternate between heuristic categories during different phases:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective**: Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Priority-Based**: Start with priority-based heuristics that can help construct an initial solution by focusing on specific job metrics.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Use `first_come_first_served_af26()` to establish a baseline schedule by dynamically prioritizing jobs.
      2. Experiment with `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()` and `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()` to explore their effectiveness in minimizing makespan.
  - **Randomized**: Occasionally introduce randomness to explore diverse initial solutions.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Use `random_6512()` briefly to create a few random initial solutions, which can help escape from bad local optima.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution by making local adjustments.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Local Optimization**: Focus on local optimization techniques to enhance the solution.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Apply `shift_operator_109f()` to make small adjustments within machine queues for potential improvements.
      2. Use `_2opt_f9c1()` for swapping pairs of operations to reduce makespan.
      3. Optionally, apply `_3opt_6ee0()` for more complex swaps if further improvement is needed.
  - **Complexity-Adaptive**: Adapt heuristics based on problem complexity and characteristics.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Use `first_come_first_served_af26()` again, with an emphasis on its complexity-adaptive nature, to dynamically adjust priorities.

#### Phase 3: Iterative Testing and Evaluation
- **Objective**: Continuously assess and adjust strategies based on performance.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Priority-Based and Complexity-Adaptive**: Re-evaluate job priorities and adapt strategies based on observed performance.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Reassess the use of priority-based heuristics like `most_work_remaining_df20()` based on job complexity and dataset diversity.
  - **Randomized**: Use sparingly to escape local optima during stagnation.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Reintroduce `random_6512()` if local optimization does not yield further improvements.

#### Considerations for Strategic Alternation
- Regularly evaluate the performance of applied heuristics by monitoring metrics such as makespan, machine utilization, and job diversity.
- Be flexible in switching between heuristics, especially when improvements stagnate.
- Leverage insights from previous solution steps and current solution status to inform future heuristic choices.
- Document heuristic performance to refine future strategy decisions.

This strategic guide provides a structured yet flexible framework for selecting and alternating between heuristic categories, enhancing the solution process for the JSSP through iterative experimentation and evaluation.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
job_num:15
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[0, 4, 1, 3, 2], [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 0, 2, 1, 4], [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [4, 0, 1, 3, 2], [4, 0, 1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3]]
job_operation_time:[[47, 57, 71, 96, 14], [75, 60, 22, 79, 65], [32, 33, 69, 31, 58], [44, 34, 51, 58, 47], [29, 44, 62, 17, 8], [15, 40, 97, 38, 66], [58, 39, 57, 20, 50], [57, 32, 87, 63, 21], [56, 84, 90, 85, 61], [15, 20, 67, 30, 70], [84, 82, 23, 45, 38], [50, 21, 18, 41, 29], [16, 52, 52, 38, 54], [37, 54, 57, 74, 62], [57, 61, 81, 30, 68]]

std_deviation_operation_time:22.058911023791623
job_operation_time_range:89

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 4 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since the current solution state indicates that no operations have been scheduled yet (all jobs are unfinished and makespan is zero), it's essential to establish a feasible initial solution. Using a priority-based heuristic can provide a structured approach to begin scheduling jobs by setting an initial order based on specific job metrics. This will help create a baseline schedule to work from in subsequent phases.
current_makespan: 0->47
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since we are still in the early stages with only one operation scheduled and a makespan of 47, it would be beneficial to continue using a priority-based heuristic to further develop the initial solution. This approach will help establish a more comprehensive baseline by leveraging job prioritization metrics, which is crucial before transitioning to optimization phases. Continuing with this category can provide more structure to the schedule and better prepare it for subsequent local optimizations.
current_makespan: 47->56
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the current solution is still in its early stages with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed, it is advisable to continue developing the initial solution using priority-based heuristics. This will further structure the schedule and provide a stronger foundation for subsequent optimization phases. The priority-based approach has shown incremental progress and can help establish a more comprehensive baseline before transitioning to local optimization.
current_makespan: 56->56
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has started to take shape with a few operations scheduled, but the makespan hasn't improved significantly. Since we have used priority-based heuristics to establish an initial structure, it is now beneficial to switch to local optimization techniques. These techniques can help refine the schedule by making small, targeted adjustments that may lead to significant improvements in makespan and job completion times. Applying local optimization at this stage can enhance the solution and prepare it for further iterative improvements.
current_makespan: 56->56
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->3

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:
current_solution:
machine_0: 0
machine_1: 
machine_2: 
machine_3: 2
machine_4: 8

finished_jobs:[]
unfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
job_operation_index:[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
job_last_operation_end_times:[47, 0, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 56, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
machine_operation_index:[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
machine_last_operation_end_times:[47, 0, 0, 32, 56]
finished_operation_num:3
current_makespan:56
num_finished_jobs:0
num_unfinished_jobs:15
average_job_completion:9.0
max_job_completion_time:56
min_job_completion_time:0
std_dev_job_completion_time:18.536450577173614
average_machine_completion:27.0
max_machine_completion_time:56
min_machine_completion_time:0
std_dev_machine_completion_time:23.340951137432253
average_idle_time_per_machine:29.0
proportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0
proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: _2opt_f9c1(local_optimization). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,randomized,complexity_adaptive

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(priority_based,local_optimization,randomized,complexity_adaptive)

2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:local_optimization
explanation: Given that the current solution has not shown a significant improvement in makespan and no jobs have been completed, it is advisable to continue with local optimization techniques. The application of the `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic did not lead to changes, suggesting that further local optimizations could still be beneficial. By persisting with local optimization, we can explore more nuanced adjustments to the schedule that may yield improvements in job completion times and overall makespan.
