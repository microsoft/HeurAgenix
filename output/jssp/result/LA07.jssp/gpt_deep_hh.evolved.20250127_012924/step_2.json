in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\n\nrandomized: this heuristic introduces randomness in job selection, which can be useful for escaping local optima but is generally less powerful due to its lack of strategic decision-making.\ndef random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.\n\ncomplexity_adaptive: these heuristics incorporate dynamic adjustments based on complexity measures like job diversity or iteration count, making them adaptable to different problem complexities and dataset characteristics.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets.

Here is a proposed guide that can be used to alternate between heuristic categories during different phases:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n- **Objective**: Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Priority-Based**: Start with priority-based heuristics that can help construct an initial solution by focusing on specific job metrics.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Use `first_come_first_served_af26()` to establish a baseline schedule by dynamically prioritizing jobs.\n      2. Experiment with `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()` and `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()` to explore their effectiveness in minimizing makespan.\n  - **Randomized**: Occasionally introduce randomness to explore diverse initial solutions.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Use `random_6512()` briefly to create a few random initial solutions, which can help escape from bad local optima.\n\n#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement\n- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution by making local adjustments.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Local Optimization**: Focus on local optimization techniques to enhance the solution.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Apply `shift_operator_109f()` to make small adjustments within machine queues for potential improvements.\n      2. Use `_2opt_f9c1()` for swapping pairs of operations to reduce makespan.\n      3. Optionally, apply `_3opt_6ee0()` for more complex swaps if further improvement is needed.\n  - **Complexity-Adaptive**: Adapt heuristics based on problem complexity and characteristics.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Use `first_come_first_served_af26()` again, with an emphasis on its complexity-adaptive nature, to dynamically adjust priorities.\n\n#### Phase 3: Iterative Testing and Evaluation\n- **Objective**: Continuously assess and adjust strategies based on performance.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Priority-Based and Complexity-Adaptive**: Re-evaluate job priorities and adapt strategies based on observed performance.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Reassess the use of priority-based heuristics like `most_work_remaining_df20()` based on job complexity and dataset diversity.\n  - **Randomized**: Use sparingly to escape local optima during stagnation.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Reintroduce `random_6512()` if local optimization does not yield further improvements.\n\n#### Considerations for Strategic Alternation\n- Regularly evaluate the performance of applied heuristics by monitoring metrics such as makespan, machine utilization, and job diversity.\n- Be flexible in switching between heuristics, especially when improvements stagnate.\n- Leverage insights from previous solution steps and current solution status to inform future heuristic choices.\n- Document heuristic performance to refine future strategy decisions.\n\nThis strategic guide provides a structured yet flexible framework for selecting and alternating between heuristic categories, enhancing the solution process for the JSSP through iterative experimentation and evaluation."
