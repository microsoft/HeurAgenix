I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations on machines, which inherently involves combinatorial decision-making to achieve objectives like minimizing the makespan. Heuristic approaches are commonly used to address JSSP due to its computational complexity and the NP-hard nature of the problem, making exact solutions infeasible for larger instances. The solution, operator framework, and data structures you've described align well with typical approaches used to tackle such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,dynamic_adjustment,makespan_optimization

priority_based: These heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time, work remaining, or other job attributes.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_optimization: These heuristics focus on optimizing the schedule by making local changes like swaps or shifts to reduce the makespan.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

dynamic_adjustment: These heuristics include dynamic scoring or adjustment mechanisms to adapt to changes in the scheduling environment.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

makespan_optimization: These heuristics explicitly aim to minimize the makespan by evaluating potential improvements through operations like swaps or shifts.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [0, 3, 4, 2, 1], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [0, 3, 2, 1, 4], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], [3, 1, 4, 0, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[21, 53, 95, 55, 34], [21, 52, 16, 26, 71], [39, 98, 42, 31, 12], [77, 55, 79, 66, 77], [83, 34, 64, 19, 37], [54, 43, 79, 92, 62], [69, 77, 87, 87, 93], [38, 60, 41, 24, 83], [17, 49, 25, 44, 98], [77, 79, 43, 75, 96]]
total_operation_num:50
average_operation_time:56.98
max_operation_time:98
min_operation_time:12
std_deviation_operation_time:25.40825849994446
job_operation_time_range:86
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To strategically guide the selection of heuristic categories and define execution steps for each phase in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we can structure our approach into two main phases: Construction and Improvement. Here's a framework to help guide your decisions:

### Phase 1: Construction Phase
The goal of this phase is to build an initial feasible solution quickly. Given your context, this phase will involve priority-based and dynamic adjustment heuristics.

#### Steps:
1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**: 
   - **Start with a simple priority-based heuristic** such as `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to establish a basic schedule. These heuristics are beneficial for quickly generating an initial solution by considering job priorities based on processing times or job attributes.
   - **Evaluate the initial schedule** to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Heuristics**:
   - **Apply dynamic adjustment heuristics** like `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `most_work_remaining_df20` to refine the initial solution by dynamically prioritizing jobs based on the current state of the schedule and machine availability.
   - **Assess the makespan and job flow** to determine if further adjustments are necessary or if the solution is ready for improvement.

### Phase 2: Improvement Phase
This phase focuses on enhancing the initial solution to optimize the objective, typically minimizing the makespan. This involves local optimization and makespan optimization heuristics.

#### Steps:
1. **Local Optimization Heuristics**:
   - **Implement local optimization heuristics** such as `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f` to make small adjustments by swapping or shifting operations to reduce the makespan incrementally.
   - **Iterate through potential improvements** and monitor changes in the makespan to ensure the solution is moving towards optimality.

2. **Makespan Optimization Heuristics**:
   - **Deploy makespan-focused heuristics** like `_3opt_6ee0` to conduct more comprehensive rearrangements of the schedule if local optimizations yield diminishing returns.
   - **Conduct iterative evaluations** after each application to measure improvements and determine the stopping criteria, such as a threshold of acceptable makespan or a maximum number of iterations.

### Iterative Process and Evaluation:
- **Switching Heuristics**: Alternate between different heuristics to explore various solution paths and avoid getting trapped in local optima. For example, after a few iterations of local optimizations, switch to makespan optimizations to explore different solution spaces.
- **Performance Metrics**: Continuously evaluate the performance of applied heuristics using metrics like the makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times to guide the switching process.
- **Heuristic Selection**: Consider the problem characteristics (e.g., job diversity, machine utilization) and use them to inform which heuristic categories might be more effective at each stage.

By following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore different heuristic approaches, leveraging their strengths at various stages of the scheduling process, and iteratively refine your solution to achieve optimal or near-optimal results.

Before this discuss, we have already 17 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since no jobs have been scheduled yet and the current solution state is at the very initial stage with all jobs unfinished, starting with a priority-based heuristic will help establish a foundational schedule. This category will provide a straightforward approach to begin constructing a feasible solution by prioritizing jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time or job attributes.
current_makespan: 0->69
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where only one operation has been scheduled and no jobs have been completed, switching to a dynamic adjustment heuristic can help adaptively refine the schedule. This category will allow us to dynamically prioritize unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability, offering a more flexible approach to scheduling the next operations. This is particularly useful at this early stage to establish a more balanced and responsive foundation for the solution.
current_makespan: 69->69
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state of the solution with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed, it would be beneficial to switch back to a priority-based heuristic. This category will help further develop the solution by focusing on scheduling additional operations based on specific criteria like processing time or work remaining. Using a priority-based heuristic will allow us to continue constructing a feasible initial solution, which is essential before moving on to more complex improvements. This approach can help improve the makespan by strategically advancing jobs that have shorter processing times or higher priority, thereby creating a more balanced and efficient schedule.
current_makespan: 69->83
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state of the solution where the makespan has increased slightly and no jobs have been completed, it would be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category can help adaptively refine the schedule by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. This approach provides flexibility and responsiveness, allowing us to better manage the schedule's development at this early stage and potentially improve the efficiency of the current solution.
current_makespan: 83->83
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->4
---Round 4---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state where the makespan has remained unchanged and no jobs have been completed, switching back to a priority-based heuristic can help further advance the schedule. By focusing on criteria such as shortest processing time or least work remaining, this category can help strategically prioritize the next operations to improve the makespan and move closer to completing jobs. Since we're still in the early stages, continuing to construct the solution with priority-based heuristics could provide a more structured foundation before moving on to more complex optimizations.
current_makespan: 83->83
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->5
---Round 5---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state where the makespan has not improved and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category can help adaptively refine the schedule by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. Dynamic adjustment heuristics offer flexibility and responsiveness, allowing the solution to adapt to current inefficiencies and potentially improve the efficiency of the schedule. This approach could help in managing the schedule's development at this stage and work towards completing some jobs.
current_makespan: 83->98
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 5->6
---Round 6---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state with no finished jobs and a makespan of 98, it would be beneficial to switch to a local optimization heuristic. This category can help improve the schedule by making small, targeted changes, such as swaps or shifts, to reduce the makespan incrementally. Since the current solution has been constructed with priority-based and dynamic adjustment heuristics, a local optimization approach can refine the existing schedule by addressing inefficiencies and exploring potential improvements in the order of operations.
current_makespan: 98->98
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 6->6
---Round 7---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Heuristic Category: makespan_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Given the current state, where the makespan has not improved and all jobs remain unfinished, switching to a makespan optimization heuristic can help explore more comprehensive adjustments to the schedule. This category focuses explicitly on minimizing the makespan and could provide significant improvements by identifying and rearranging inefficient sequences. Since local optimizations have not yielded improvements, a broader approach targeting makespan directly may be more effective at this stage.
current_makespan: 98->98
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 6->6
---Round 8---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state where the makespan has remained unchanged despite attempts with makespan optimization, shifting to a local optimization heuristic could help identify and implement small, targeted improvements. Local optimization heuristics like swaps or shifts can incrementally address inefficiencies in the sequence of operations. Since the current solution has a high makespan with no finished jobs, a local optimization approach might refine the schedule by making precise adjustments to the order of operations, potentially unlocking improvements that previous strategies did not achieve.
current_makespan: 98->98
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 6->6
---Round 9---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where the makespan has remained unchanged across several rounds and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category allows for adaptive refinement by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. Dynamic adjustment heuristics offer flexibility and responsiveness, potentially addressing inefficiencies in the current schedule and providing a new perspective to develop the solution further.
current_makespan: 98->154
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 6->7
---Round 10---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current state shows that the makespan has increased to 154, and no jobs have been completed despite using dynamic adjustment heuristics. This suggests that while dynamic prioritization was attempted, it did not effectively reduce the makespan or advance job completion. Shifting to local optimization can help make targeted adjustments to the sequence of operations, potentially unlocking improvements by addressing inefficiencies in a more granular manner. Local optimizations like swaps or shifts can refine the schedule by implementing small, precise changes, which might be more effective given the current high idle times and low job completion rates.
current_makespan: 154->154
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 7->7
---Round 11---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: makespan_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where the makespan has increased to 154 and no jobs have been completed, it suggests that local optimizations have not effectively reduced the makespan or advanced job completion. Switching to a makespan optimization heuristic can help explore more comprehensive adjustments to the schedule. This category explicitly focuses on minimizing the makespan and could provide significant improvements by identifying and rearranging inefficient sequences. Since previous strategies did not yield desired results, a broader approach targeting makespan directly may uncover more effective solutions.
current_makespan: 154->154
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 7->7
---Round 12---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Given the current state, where the makespan has remained at 154 and no jobs have been completed, it suggests that the makespan optimization approach did not yield significant improvements. Switching to local optimization can help make targeted adjustments by focusing on specific sequences or operations that could be blocking progress. Local optimization allows for precise interventions, such as swaps or shifts, that might uncover efficiencies or unlock progress that broader approaches have missed. This category is well-suited for addressing bottlenecks and refining the schedule incrementally, which could be more effective given the current high idle times and low job completion rates.
current_makespan: 154->154
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 7->7
---Round 13---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state with all jobs unfinished, a high makespan of 154, and no significant improvement from recent local optimization attempts, it might be beneficial to revisit a priority-based heuristic. This category can help re-establish an effective scheduling foundation by prioritizing jobs based on specific criteria, potentially addressing bottlenecks and re-aligning the schedule towards completion. By focusing on operations with shorter processing times or most work remaining, we can create a more structured initial solution that paves the way for subsequent improvements.
current_makespan: 154->154
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 7->8
---Round 14---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where the makespan remains high and no jobs have been completed, it suggests that the previous approaches have not effectively moved the solution towards completion. Switching to a local optimization heuristic can help make targeted adjustments by focusing on specific sequences or operations that might be causing bottlenecks. Local optimization allows for precise interventions, such as swaps or shifts, that could uncover efficiencies or unlock progress that broader approaches have missed. This category is well-suited for addressing bottlenecks and refining the schedule incrementally, which could be more effective given the current high idle times and low job completion rates.

---Round 15---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, with a high makespan and no finished jobs, dynamic adjustment heuristics could provide the flexibility needed to adaptively prioritize operations that can break bottlenecks and enhance machine utilization. Since local optimization has not yielded significant improvements, a dynamic approach might better respond to current scheduling inefficiencies and offer a fresh perspective to drive the solution forward.

---Round 16---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, the makespan remains high at 154 with all jobs unfinished, indicating inefficiencies in the schedule. Local optimization heuristics can make precise, targeted adjustments to the order of operations, potentially unlocking improvements by addressing bottlenecks and inefficiencies. By focusing on small, incremental changes, this approach may help reduce idle times and improve machine utilization, ultimately lowering the makespan and advancing job completion.

The last heuristic category is: most_work_remaining_df20(local_optimization). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,dynamic_adjustment,makespan_optimization

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:makespan_optimization
explanation: Given the current state with a high makespan of 154 and no finished jobs, it's clear that the schedule is not progressing efficiently. Previous attempts using local optimization and dynamic adjustment have not yielded significant improvements. To address this, switching to the makespan optimization category could help explore more comprehensive rearrangements of the schedule. This approach focuses explicitly on minimizing the makespan and could provide significant improvements by identifying and rearranging inefficient sequences, potentially unlocking progress that other heuristics have missed.
