In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

Here's a framework to help guide your decisions:\n\n### Phase 1: Construction Phase\nThe goal of this phase is to build an initial feasible solution quickly. Given your context, this phase will involve priority-based and dynamic adjustment heuristics.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**: \n   - **Start with a simple priority-based heuristic** such as `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to establish a basic schedule. These heuristics are beneficial for quickly generating an initial solution by considering job priorities based on processing times or job attributes.\n   - **Evaluate the initial schedule** to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n\n2. **Dynamic Adjustment Heuristics**:\n   - **Apply dynamic adjustment heuristics** like `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` or `most_work_remaining_df20` to refine the initial solution by dynamically prioritizing jobs based on the current state of the schedule and machine availability.\n   - **Assess the makespan and job flow** to determine if further adjustments are necessary or if the solution is ready for improvement.\n\n### Phase 2: Improvement Phase\nThis phase focuses on enhancing the initial solution to optimize the objective, typically minimizing the makespan. This involves local optimization and makespan optimization heuristics.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Local Optimization Heuristics**:\n   - **Implement local optimization heuristics** such as `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f` to make small adjustments by swapping or shifting operations to reduce the makespan incrementally.\n   - **Iterate through potential improvements** and monitor changes in the makespan to ensure the solution is moving towards optimality.\n\n2. **Makespan Optimization Heuristics**:\n   - **Deploy makespan-focused heuristics** like `_3opt_6ee0` to conduct more comprehensive rearrangements of the schedule if local optimizations yield diminishing returns.\n   - **Conduct iterative evaluations** after each application to measure improvements and determine the stopping criteria, such as a threshold of acceptable makespan or a maximum number of iterations.\n\n### Iterative Process and Evaluation:\n- **Switching Heuristics**: Alternate between different heuristics to explore various solution paths and avoid getting trapped in local optima. For example, after a few iterations of local optimizations, switch to makespan optimizations to explore different solution spaces.\n- **Performance Metrics**: Continuously evaluate the performance of applied heuristics using metrics like the makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times to guide the switching process.\n- **Heuristic Selection**: Consider the problem characteristics (e.g., job diversity, machine utilization) and use them to inform which heuristic categories might be more effective at each stage.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore different heuristic approaches, leveraging their strengths at various stages of the scheduling process, and iteratively refine your solution to achieve optimal or near-optimal results."

This category will provide a straightforward approach to begin constructing a feasible solution by prioritizing jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time or job attributes.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->69\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: first_come_first_served_af26\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where only one operation has been scheduled and no jobs have been completed, switching to a dynamic adjustment heuristic can help adaptively refine the schedule. This category will allow us to dynamically prioritize unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability, offering a more flexible approach to scheduling the next operations. This is particularly useful at this early stage to establish a more balanced and responsive foundation for the solution.\ncurrent_makespan: 69->69\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed, it would be beneficial to switch back to a priority-based heuristic. This category will help further develop the solution by focusing on scheduling additional operations based on specific criteria like processing time or work remaining. Using a priority-based heuristic will allow us to continue constructing a feasible initial solution, which is essential before moving on to more complex improvements. This approach can help improve the makespan by strategically advancing jobs that have shorter processing times or higher priority, thereby creating a more balanced and efficient schedule.\ncurrent_makespan: 69->83\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: first_come_first_served_af26\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution where the makespan has increased slightly and no jobs have been completed, it would be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category can help adaptively refine the schedule by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. This approach provides flexibility and responsiveness, allowing us to better manage the schedule's development at this early stage and potentially improve the efficiency of the current solution.\ncurrent_makespan: 83->83\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the makespan has remained unchanged and no jobs have been completed, switching back to a priority-based heuristic can help further advance the schedule. By focusing on criteria such as shortest processing time or least work remaining, this category can help strategically prioritize the next operations to improve the makespan and move closer to completing jobs. Since we're still in the early stages, continuing to construct the solution with priority-based heuristics could provide a more structured foundation before moving on to more complex optimizations.\ncurrent_makespan: 83->83\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->5\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the makespan has not improved and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category can help adaptively refine the schedule by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. Dynamic adjustment heuristics offer flexibility and responsiveness, allowing the solution to adapt to current inefficiencies and potentially improve the efficiency of the schedule. This approach could help in managing the schedule's development at this stage and work towards completing some jobs.\ncurrent_makespan: 83->98\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->6\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state with no finished jobs and a makespan of 98, it would be beneficial to switch to a local optimization heuristic. This category can help improve the schedule by making small, targeted changes, such as swaps or shifts, to reduce the makespan incrementally. Since the current solution has been constructed with priority-based and dynamic adjustment heuristics, a local optimization approach can refine the existing schedule by addressing inefficiencies and exploring potential improvements in the order of operations.\ncurrent_makespan: 98->98\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->6\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nHeuristic Category: makespan_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state, where the makespan has not improved and all jobs remain unfinished, switching to a makespan optimization heuristic can help explore more comprehensive adjustments to the schedule. This category focuses explicitly on minimizing the makespan and could provide significant improvements by identifying and rearranging inefficient sequences. Since local optimizations have not yielded improvements, a broader approach targeting makespan directly may be more effective at this stage.\ncurrent_makespan: 98->98\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->6\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the makespan has remained unchanged despite attempts with makespan optimization, shifting to a local optimization heuristic could help identify and implement small, targeted improvements. Local optimization heuristics like swaps or shifts can incrementally address inefficiencies in the sequence of operations. Since the current solution has a high makespan with no finished jobs, a local optimization approach might refine the schedule by making precise adjustments to the order of operations, potentially unlocking improvements that previous strategies did not achieve.\ncurrent_makespan: 98->98\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->6\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_adjustment\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where the makespan has remained unchanged across several rounds and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to switch to a dynamic adjustment heuristic. This category allows for adaptive refinement by dynamically prioritizing unfinished jobs based on their potential impact on the makespan and machine availability. Dynamic adjustment heuristics offer flexibility and responsiveness, potentially addressing inefficiencies in the current schedule and providing a new perspective to develop the solution further.\ncurrent_makespan: 98->154\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->7\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current state shows that the makespan has increased to 154, and no jobs have been completed despite using dynamic adjustment heuristics. This suggests that while dynamic prioritization was attempted, it did not effectively reduce the makespan or advance job completion. Shifting to local optimization can help make targeted adjustments to the sequence of operations, potentially unlocking improvements by addressing inefficiencies in a more granular manner. Local optimizations like swaps or shifts can refine the schedule by implementing small, precise changes, which might be more effective given the current high idle times and low job completion rates.\ncurrent_makespan: 154->154\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 7->7\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nmachine_0: 4\nmachine_1: 0->3\nmachine_2: 7\nmachine_3: 6\nmachine_4: 9->6\n\nfinished_jobs:[]\nunfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\njob_operation_index:[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1]\njob_last_operation_end_times:[21, 0, 0, 98, 83, 0, 154, 38, 0, 77]\nmachine_operation_index:[1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nmachine_last_operation_end_times:[83, 98, 38, 69, 154]\nfinished_operation_num:7\ncurrent_makespan:154\nnum_finished_jobs:0\nnum_unfinished_jobs:10\naverage_job_completion:47.1\nmax_job_completion_time:154\nmin_job_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_job_completion_time:50.83197812401166\naverage_machine_completion:88.4\nmax_machine_completion_time:154\nmin_machine_completion_time:38\nstd_dev_machine_completion_time:38.317619967842475\naverage_idle_time_per_machine:65.6\nproportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0\nproportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: _2opt_f9c1(local_optimization).

Switching to a makespan optimization heuristic can help explore more comprehensive adjustments to the schedule. This category explicitly focuses on minimizing the makespan and could provide significant improvements by identifying and rearranging inefficient sequences. Since previous strategies did not yield desired results, a broader approach targeting makespan directly may uncover more effective solutions.\n***"
