I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations across machines, which is a classic example of a combinatorial problem. The framework you've built for the solution and operators is aligned with the nature of heuristic-based approaches, where different operators modify solutions to explore the solution space. Your use of operators to perform actions like advancing operations, swapping, reversing sequences, and shifting operations corresponds well with heuristic methods used for solving such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing scenarios for each heuristic can be essential to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and applicable contexts. Below is a brief analysis of scenarios for each heuristic you have implemented:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) with Dynamic Scoring `d471`:**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is beneficial when you have a mix of short and long tasks and want to reduce the waiting time for shorter tasks. It works well in environments where minimizing idle time for machines is crucial.
   - **Quantification:** Measure effectiveness by the average wait time per job and machine utilization rate.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) `af26`:**
   - **Scenario:** FCFS is applicable when fairness or simplicity is prioritized over optimality. It's useful in environments where job arrival time is crucial.
   - **Quantification:** Assess by comparing makespan and job tardiness, especially in systems with high variability in job arrival times.

3. **Most Work Remaining `df20`:**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is useful when there are significant variations in job sizes and prioritizing larger jobs early can help prevent bottlenecks later on.
   - **Quantification:** Evaluate by the total completion time and bottleneck analysis to see if larger jobs are causing delays.

4. **Shift Operator `109f`:**
   - **Scenario:** Effective in fine-tuning already near-optimal solutions by exploring local neighborhoods of the solution space.
   - **Quantification:** Measure by the reduction in makespan or improvement in solution quality after applying shifts.

5. **3-opt Heuristic `6ee0`:**
   - **Scenario:** Applicable when a solution needs significant rearrangement for improvement, especially in more complex or dense job sequences.
   - **Quantification:** Compare initial and final makespan and count the number of successful improvements made by the heuristic.

6. **Longest Job Next `2e23`:**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable in environments where longer jobs could become bottlenecks and need to be started earlier to ensure timely completion.
   - **Quantification:** Analyze by checking the variance in job completion times and makespan.

7. **2-opt Heuristic `f9c1`:**
   - **Scenario:** Useful for large, complex problems where incremental improvements are needed. It focuses on optimizing the sequencing of operations.
   - **Quantification:** Evaluate by the frequency and magnitude of improvements in the makespan.

8. **Random Selection `6512`:**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is useful in exploratory phases or when combined with other heuristics in a stochastic optimization approach to escape local optima.
   - **Quantification:** Track diversity in solutions and convergence behavior over multiple runs.

9. **Longest Processing Time First `9dc9`:**
   - **Scenario:** Effective when prioritizing longer tasks could lead to early completion of challenging jobs, reducing potential future delays.
   - **Quantification:** Measure by comparing makespan and the distribution of idle times across machines.

10. **Least Work Remaining `66c9`:**
    - **Scenario:** Suitable when aiming to quickly finish jobs to free up resources, especially in systems with high variability in job sizes.
    - **Quantification:** Assess by the decrease in the number of unfinished jobs over time and overall resource utilization.

11. **Shortest Job Next `5b42`:**
    - **Scenario:** Best used when the system aims to minimize the completion time of the shortest jobs first, often beneficial in high-throughput environments.
    - **Quantification:** Evaluate by comparing the average job completion time and turnover rate.

Each heuristic can be selected based on the specific characteristics and goals of the scheduling environment, and quantification can help determine the most effective heuristic for a given scenario.

Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the initial state with no jobs started, the Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) heuristic can help quickly reduce idle time and effectively utilize machines. This approach is suitable as it prioritizes operations with shorter processing times, potentially leading to an efficient initial schedule. Running for 10 steps provides a substantial start, allowing us to evaluate the initial progression and refine the approach if necessary.
Delta of current_makespan: 172
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_d471. How does shortest_processing_time_first_d471 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Given the current state data and the heuristic you previously used (shortest_processing_time_first_d471), it seems that the solution has not yet advanced significantly in terms of reducing the makespan or increasing the number of finished jobs. The focus now should be on further reducing idle times and improving machine utilization.

Considering the global and state data, as well as your previous choice, a different heuristic might provide a fresh approach to improving the solution:

- The **Most Work Remaining `df20`** heuristic could be a good choice. This heuristic prioritizes jobs with the most work remaining, which can help in cases where some jobs might become bottlenecks if not addressed promptly. Given that no jobs are finished, focusing on jobs with more work left might help in balancing the workload distribution across machines.

Here's my recommendation for the next steps:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
running steps: 15
explanation: The Most Work Remaining heuristic will help to address potential bottlenecks by focusing on jobs with the highest remaining workload. Running for 15 steps can help redistribute the workload more evenly across machines and potentially decrease the current makespan.
