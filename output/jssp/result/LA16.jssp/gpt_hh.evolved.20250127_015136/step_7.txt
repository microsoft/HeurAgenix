I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using heuristic and hyper-heuristic approaches. Your framework for representing solutions and operators is structured to facilitate the application of various heuristic strategies, which is suitable for solving such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To analyze the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), it's important to consider the specific characteristics of each heuristic and the types of problem instances they are suited to address. Here's an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial in scenarios where minimizing the idle time of machines can significantly improve efficiency. It works well when operations have varying processing times and aligning them optimally is crucial for minimizing the makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Problems with high variance in operation times; fewer machines relative to jobs.

2. **first_come_first_served_af26**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized, and quick decision-making is necessary. It adapts well to dynamic job arrivals in real-time scheduling.
   - **Quantification**: High job arrival rates; dynamic scheduling environments.

3. **most_work_remaining_df20**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in scenarios where completing lengthy jobs early can prevent bottlenecks later in the schedule. Ideal for projects with critical long-duration tasks.
   - **Quantification**: Projects with a few jobs but large differences in total processing times.

4. **shift_operator_109f**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in fine-tuning and improving existing schedules. Effective when small adjustments can lead to significant makespan reductions.
   - **Quantification**: Relatively stable initial schedules needing optimization; low variance in operation times.

5. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in cases where there are opportunities to significantly rearrange operations within the constraints of job sequencing. Itâs beneficial for complex schedules where local optimization is key.
   - **Quantification**: Complex schedules with multiple feasible operation sequences.

6. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Works well when prioritizing jobs with longer processing times can streamline the overall schedule. Especially useful when the longest jobs are critical to the project completion.
   - **Quantification**: Projects where a few jobs dominate the total workload.

7. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for incremental improvements in schedules where swapping can lead to better utilization and reduced waiting times.
   - **Quantification**: Moderate complexity with potential for improving operation sequences.

8. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in exploratory phases of scheduling where randomization can help escape local optima and explore diverse scheduling possibilities.
   - **Quantification**: Initial scheduling phases or when facing local optima traps.

9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when balancing workload across machines is crucial and long operations can be scheduled early to ensure availability for other jobs later.
   - **Quantification**: Balanced workload requirements; high variance in operation times.

10. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
    - **Scenario**: Best suited for scenarios where finishing jobs quickly can free up resources for other tasks, especially in environments with limited machine availability.
    - **Quantification**: Resource-constrained environments; high job turnover rates.

11. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where quick completion of jobs is necessary, such as in fast-paced manufacturing settings where throughput is crucial.
    - **Quantification**: High volume, low complexity jobs; focus on throughput.

Each heuristic is best suited to specific types of JSSP instances, characterized by job and machine parameters, processing time distributions, and scheduling priorities. Understanding these scenarios can guide the selection and application of heuristics to achieve optimal scheduling performance.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_f9c1. How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the provided data and the outcomes of the previous heuristic runs, it appears that the solution is still evolving, with room for further optimization. The last heuristic used, **_2opt_f9c1**, showed a reduction in makespan, indicating potential for additional improvements. However, no operations were completed during this run, suggesting that while it helped reduce the makespan, it may not be the most effective in advancing job completions at this stage.

Given the current state, a strategic switch to another heuristic might be beneficial. Considering the high variance in operation times and the need to advance unfinished jobs, **longest_job_next_2e23** could help address bottlenecks by prioritizing jobs with the most remaining work.

Here's my recommendation for the next step:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
running steps: 15
hype parameter(optional):
explanation: Switching to the Longest Job Next heuristic is aimed at addressing bottlenecks by prioritizing jobs with the most remaining work. This should help balance workload across machines and potentially reduce the makespan further while advancing job completions.
