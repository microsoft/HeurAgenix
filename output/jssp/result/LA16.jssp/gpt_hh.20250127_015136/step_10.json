In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

                "text": "Based on the information provided, especially the current state and the performance of the \"least_work_remaining_66c9\" heuristic in previous rounds, here are some considerations:\n\n- The \"least_work_remaining_66c9\" heuristic has been effective in reducing the makespan and completing jobs over several rounds. However, the last run showed no improvement in makespan or finished jobs, indicating potential diminishing returns from this heuristic in the current state.\n- With a high proportion of unfinished jobs and machine utilization at 0.9, there might still be room for optimization, possibly by shifting focus to another heuristic or by fine-tuning the current approach.\n\nGiven these considerations, a strategic shift might be warranted to attempt further improvement:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nrunning steps: 5\nexplanation: The \"longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\" heuristic could address bottlenecks caused by long operations, potentially improving balance and completion rates in the schedule. Given the recent stagnation with \"least_work_remaining_66c9,\" this shift aims to explore new opportunities for optimization.\n***"
