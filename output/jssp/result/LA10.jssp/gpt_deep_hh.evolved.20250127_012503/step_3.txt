I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. Your framework, with the defined Solution and Operator classes, aligns well with the structure of such problems, allowing for the manipulation and evaluation of potential solutions. The proposed heuristic function signature provides a standardized way to apply different heuristic strategies to this problem.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,work_remaining,processing_time_based,local_optimization

priority_based: These heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time, arrival order, or remaining job length.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

work_remaining: These heuristics focus on the amount of work remaining for each job to determine scheduling priority.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.

processing_time_based: These heuristics emphasize the processing time of jobs to decide scheduling, either by selecting the longest or shortest processing time first.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.

local_optimization: These heuristics attempt to optimize the current schedule by making local changes, such as swapping operations or shifting within a machine's queue.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:15
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 2, 3, 0, 4], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4], [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], [3, 4, 2, 0, 1], [1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[58, 44, 5, 9, 58], [89, 97, 96, 77, 84], [77, 87, 81, 39, 85], [57, 21, 31, 15, 73], [48, 40, 49, 70, 71], [34, 82, 80, 10, 22], [91, 75, 55, 17, 7], [62, 47, 72, 35, 11], [64, 75, 50, 90, 94], [67, 20, 15, 12, 71], [52, 93, 68, 29, 57], [70, 58, 93, 7, 77], [27, 82, 63, 6, 95], [87, 56, 36, 26, 48], [76, 36, 36, 15, 8]]
total_operation_num:75
average_operation_time:53.6
max_operation_time:97
min_operation_time:5
std_deviation_operation_time:28.127329533154523
job_operation_time_range:92
average_job_length:5.0
max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase in solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), it's crucial to consider both the construction and improvement phases of the solution process. This guide will help in systematically alternating between different heuristics to optimize the scheduling efficiently.

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Construction Phase
- **Objective**: Build an initial feasible solution.
  
1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**:
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26()` to quickly generate an initial schedule based on arrival order.
     - Use `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()` to refine the initial schedule by prioritizing jobs with shorter processing times, which helps in reducing the initial makespan.
   - **Switch Strategy**: Evaluate the initial makespan and use metrics like machine utilization and job diversity to decide if further refinement is needed.

2. **Work Remaining Heuristics**:
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Implement `least_work_remaining_66c9()` to prioritize jobs with the least work remaining, aiming to quickly wrap up shorter jobs and free up machine time for longer jobs.
   - **Switch Strategy**: After initial schedule completion, assess the balance between machine idle times and job completion times to identify optimization potential.

3. **Processing Time-Based Heuristics**:
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()` to address bottlenecks by scheduling longer jobs early, ensuring they don't delay other jobs.
   - **Switch Strategy**: If the makespan is excessively high, consider balancing it by alternating with `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()`.

#### Phase 2: Improvement Phase
- **Objective**: Optimize the initial solution by making local changes to reduce the makespan and improve efficiency.

1. **Local Optimization Heuristics**:
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Start with `_2opt_f9c1()` to perform small swaps of non-adjacent operations, potentially reducing the makespan significantly.
     - Progress to `_3opt_6ee0()` for more complex swaps if `_2opt_f9c1()` doesn't yield satisfactory improvements.
     - Use `shift_operator_109f()` to explore shifting operations within the same machine's queue for better alignment and reduced idle times.
   - **Switch Strategy**: Continuously monitor the makespan reduction and machine utilization. If improvements plateau, switch between the local optimization heuristics to explore different permutations.

2. **Priority and Processing Time-Based Heuristics**:
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Re-evaluate the solution using priority-based heuristics like `shortest_job_next_5b42()` to ensure jobs are aligned with the optimal trajectory.
     - Use `longest_job_next_2e23()` to focus on jobs with longer processing times if they are causing bottlenecks.
   - **Switch Strategy**: If local optimizations yield diminishing returns, integrate these heuristics to re-prioritize and re-balance the schedule.

### Iterative Approach
- **Assessment and Feedback**: After each iteration, assess the performance using metrics such as makespan, machine utilization, and job diversity. Use this feedback to decide on switching heuristics or modifying execution steps.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Be prepared to dynamically adjust the heuristic strategy based on the problem instance characteristics and observed performance trends.

This strategic guide provides a structured approach to selecting and alternating heuristics during the solution process, enabling an iterative exploration of various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness in solving the JSSP.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
job_num:15
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[1, 2, 3, 0, 4], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4], [2, 0, 1, 3, 4], [3, 4, 2, 0, 1], [1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[58, 44, 5, 9, 58], [89, 97, 96, 77, 84], [77, 87, 81, 39, 85], [57, 21, 31, 15, 73], [48, 40, 49, 70, 71], [34, 82, 80, 10, 22], [91, 75, 55, 17, 7], [62, 47, 72, 35, 11], [64, 75, 50, 90, 94], [67, 20, 15, 12, 71], [52, 93, 68, 29, 57], [70, 58, 93, 7, 77], [27, 82, 63, 6, 95], [87, 56, 36, 26, 48], [76, 36, 36, 15, 8]]
total_operation_num:75

std_deviation_operation_time:28.127329533154523
job_operation_time_range:92

max_job_length:5
min_job_length:5
machine_utilization:0.8
job_diversity:5
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: At this initial stage, where no operations have been scheduled and all jobs are unfinished, using a priority-based heuristic is beneficial for constructing an initial feasible solution. These heuristics can quickly establish a baseline schedule by prioritizing jobs based on criteria like arrival order or processing time, which can then be further refined in subsequent phases.
current_makespan: 0->58
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  At this early stage, with only one operation scheduled and all jobs still unfinished, continuing with a priority-based heuristic can help further develop the initial solution. By leveraging the prioritization capabilities of the priority-based heuristics, you can establish a more structured schedule that can be refined in subsequent phases. This approach will ensure a smoother transition into the improvement phase by setting a solid foundation.
current_makespan: 58->77
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: work_remaining
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  At this stage, with only two operations scheduled and no jobs finished, switching to the work_remaining heuristic category can be beneficial. This approach will allow us to focus on jobs with the least or most work remaining, helping to efficiently manage the scheduling priority and potentially reduce the makespan. This change aims to balance the workload across machines and prevent bottlenecks by advancing jobs that can be completed sooner, thus setting a more structured foundation for further improvements.
current_makespan: 77->77
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:
current_solution:
machine_0: 2
machine_1: 0
machine_2: 
machine_3: 3
machine_4: 

finished_jobs:[]
unfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
job_operation_index:[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
job_last_operation_end_times:[58, 0, 77, 57, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
machine_operation_index:[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
machine_last_operation_end_times:[77, 58, 0, 57, 0]
finished_operation_num:3
current_makespan:77
num_finished_jobs:0
num_unfinished_jobs:15
average_job_completion:12.8
max_job_completion_time:77
min_job_completion_time:0
std_dev_job_completion_time:25.928619965847265
average_machine_completion:38.4
max_machine_completion_time:77
min_machine_completion_time:0
std_dev_machine_completion_time:32.15338240372232
average_idle_time_per_machine:38.6
proportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0
proportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: longest_job_next_2e23(work_remaining). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,work_remaining,processing_time_based,local_optimization

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(priority_based,work_remaining,processing_time_based,local_optimization)

2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:processing_time_based
explanation: With the current makespan remaining unchanged and no jobs completed after using the longest_job_next_2e23 heuristic, it's beneficial to switch to a processing_time_based heuristic. This category can help address bottlenecks by focusing on jobs with either the longest or shortest processing times, potentially reducing idle times and improving the overall schedule. By targeting specific job processing times, we can enhance the efficiency of the current solution and create opportunities for subsequent improvements.
