in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\n\nwork_remaining: These heuristics focus on the amount of work remaining for each job to determine scheduling priority.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\n\nprocessing_time_based: These heuristics emphasize the processing time of jobs to decide scheduling, either by selecting the longest or shortest processing time first.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\n\nlocal_optimization: These heuristics attempt to optimize the current schedule by making local changes, such as swapping operations or shifting within a machine's queue.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

This guide will help in systematically alternating between different heuristics to optimize the scheduling efficiently.\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Construction Phase\n- **Objective**: Build an initial feasible solution.\n  \n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics**:\n   - **Execution Steps**:\n     - Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26()` to quickly generate an initial schedule based on arrival order.\n     - Use `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()` to refine the initial schedule by prioritizing jobs with shorter processing times, which helps in reducing the initial makespan.\n   - **Switch Strategy**: Evaluate the initial makespan and use metrics like machine utilization and job diversity to decide if further refinement is needed.\n\n2. **Work Remaining Heuristics**:\n   - **Execution Steps**:\n     - Implement `least_work_remaining_66c9()` to prioritize jobs with the least work remaining, aiming to quickly wrap up shorter jobs and free up machine time for longer jobs.\n   - **Switch Strategy**: After initial schedule completion, assess the balance between machine idle times and job completion times to identify optimization potential.\n\n3. **Processing Time-Based Heuristics**:\n   - **Execution Steps**:\n     - Apply `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()` to address bottlenecks by scheduling longer jobs early, ensuring they don't delay other jobs.\n   - **Switch Strategy**: If the makespan is excessively high, consider balancing it by alternating with `shortest_processing_time_first_d471()`.\n\n#### Phase 2: Improvement Phase\n- **Objective**: Optimize the initial solution by making local changes to reduce the makespan and improve efficiency.\n\n1. **Local Optimization Heuristics**:\n   - **Execution Steps**:\n     - Start with `_2opt_f9c1()` to perform small swaps of non-adjacent operations, potentially reducing the makespan significantly.\n     - Progress to `_3opt_6ee0()` for more complex swaps if `_2opt_f9c1()` doesn't yield satisfactory improvements.\n     - Use `shift_operator_109f()` to explore shifting operations within the same machine's queue for better alignment and reduced idle times.\n   - **Switch Strategy**: Continuously monitor the makespan reduction and machine utilization. If improvements plateau, switch between the local optimization heuristics to explore different permutations.\n\n2. **Priority and Processing Time-Based Heuristics**:\n   - **Execution Steps**:\n     - Re-evaluate the solution using priority-based heuristics like `shortest_job_next_5b42()` to ensure jobs are aligned with the optimal trajectory.\n     - Use `longest_job_next_2e23()` to focus on jobs with longer processing times if they are causing bottlenecks.\n   - **Switch Strategy**: If local optimizations yield diminishing returns, integrate these heuristics to re-prioritize and re-balance the schedule.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Assessment and Feedback**: After each iteration, assess the performance using metrics such as makespan, machine utilization, and job diversity. Use this feedback to decide on switching heuristics or modifying execution steps.\n- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Be prepared to dynamically adjust the heuristic strategy based on the problem instance characteristics and observed performance trends.\n\nThis strategic guide provides a structured approach to selecting and alternating heuristics during the solution process, enabling an iterative exploration of various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness in solving the JSSP."
