in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Although recent rounds have shown no change, the 2-opt approach has historically been effective in uncovering subtle inefficiencies in the operation sequence. Increasing the number of steps to 20 could provide the additional exploration needed to achieve further improvements.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: _2opt_f9c1. How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

Although it was initially successful in reducing the makespan, continuing with it may not yield further gains at this point. \n\nConsidering the current data and the performance of other heuristics in past rounds, it might be beneficial to try a different approach that could potentially break the plateau. The \"shift_operator_109f\" or \"most_work_remaining_df20\" heuristics might be worth revisiting or trying for more steps, as these could offer new insights or improvements by focusing on different aspects of the problem.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: shift_operator_109f\nrunning steps: 25\nexplanation: Exploring the shift_operator_109f heuristic may help uncover local optimizations within the machine's queue that have not been addressed by the _2opt_f9c1 heuristic. By increasing the number of steps, we aim to thoroughly explore potential improvements and address the plateau in recent rounds.\n***"
