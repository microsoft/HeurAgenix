In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

Best for instances where minor adjustments can lead to significant improvements in the makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the makespan is close to optimal, and the schedule needs fine-tuning.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for systems where short tasks need to be prioritized to quickly free up resources, leading to potentially reduced idle times for machines.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied in environments with many short-duration tasks, minimizing the waiting time for subsequent operations.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Suited for complex scheduling problems where larger-scale rearrangements of operations can significantly reduce the makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective for larger job sets where multiple operations can be re-sequenced to gain efficiency.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Useful when prioritizing jobs with the longest remaining time to minimize the impact of lengthy tasks on the overall schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Best when long-duration tasks dominate the schedule, aiming to reduce their bottleneck effect.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Applicable where swaps of non-adjacent operations can lead to a better sequence, particularly when initial schedules are not well-optimized.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for medium-sized problems where swapping pairs can reduce the makespan significantly.\n\n6. **random_6512**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Best for exploratory phases of scheduling or when the solution space is vast and complex, providing diverse potential solutions.\n   - **Quantification**: Useful in very large or complex instances where traditional methods fail to escape local optima.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Effective when the focus is on jobs that, if completed, will significantly reduce the remaining workload.\n   - **Quantification**: Best when there's a wide disparity in job durations, aiming to complete heavy workloads sooner.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where prioritizing long operations helps in resource management, ensuring that significant tasks are completed first.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in settings where machine time is expensive, and long tasks need to be efficiently managed.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:  \n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for systems where completing small jobs can quickly reduce the number of active jobs, simplifying the scheduling problem.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective for instances with many small tasks that can be quickly completed to clear the schedule.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:  \n    - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where shorter jobs need to be prioritized to maximize throughput and minimize average job completion time.\n    - **Quantification**: Best applied in settings with numerous short tasks, enhancing flow efficiency.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:  \n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in scenarios where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over optimization, ensuring jobs are processed in the order they arrive.\n    - **Quantification**: Useful in systems with low variability in job size and processing time, maintaining a straightforward queue.\n\nThese heuristics are often best applied in combination or as part of a larger hyper-heuristic approach, where different strategies are dynamically selected based on real-time analysis of the scheduling environment.

This heuristic prioritizes operations with the shortest processing time, which can help in quickly advancing the schedule and reducing idle times initially. With the average operation time being 53.6 and a significant standard deviation, starting with shorter operations will allow us to assess the schedule's responsiveness and adjust as needed.\nDelta of current_makespan: 137\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 5\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, the application of the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic has not yet resulted in any completed jobs, but it has advanced the scheduling process by executing 5 operations. With the significant standard deviation in operation times, continuing with this heuristic can help to strategically reduce initial idle times and balance the workload. As the average operation time is relatively high, running additional steps should help in further reducing the makespan and potentially lead to the completion of some jobs. Therefore, I recommend running an additional 10 steps with this heuristic to further refine the initial schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 195\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: shortest_processing_time_first_c374. How does shortest_processing_time_first_c374 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.

However, it may not be sufficient alone to quickly complete the remaining jobs, especially given the wide range in operation times and the high standard deviation.\n\n3. **Potential Next Steps**: Considering the current state and the fact that only one job is finished, it might be beneficial to switch to a heuristic that focuses on completing jobs more rapidly, such as the **Most Work Remaining** or **Longest Job Next** heuristics. These could help in further reducing the makespan by prioritizing jobs with more work remaining or those that have a longer total processing time left.\n\n4. **Decision**: I suggest transitioning to a heuristic that focuses on completing more jobs to further reduce the makespan.
