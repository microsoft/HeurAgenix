in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic prioritizes operations with the shortest processing time, which can help in quickly advancing the schedule and reducing idle times initially. With the average operation time being 53.6 and a significant standard deviation, starting with shorter operations will allow us to assess the schedule's responsiveness and adjust as needed.\nDelta of current_makespan: 137\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 5\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_c374\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, the application of the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic has not yet resulted in any completed jobs, but it has advanced the scheduling process by executing 5 operations. With the significant standard deviation in operation times, continuing with this heuristic can help to strategically reduce initial idle times and balance the workload. As the average operation time is relatively high, running additional steps should help in further reducing the makespan and potentially lead to the completion of some jobs. Therefore, I recommend running an additional 10 steps with this heuristic to further refine the initial schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 195\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 1\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Transitioning to the Most Work Remaining heuristic will prioritize jobs with the highest remaining work, potentially leading to more balanced machine utilization and faster job completion. This approach aims to build upon the progress made by the previous heuristic and further reduce the makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 369\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Continuing with \"most_work_remaining_930e\" aims to further balance the workload and advance job completion, building on the progress made in reducing the makespan. Given the high proportion of unfinished jobs, additional steps can help in achieving a more optimized schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 233\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Continuing with \"most_work_remaining_930e\" aims to further reduce the makespan by balancing the workload across machines and advancing job completion.

This approach aims to continue balancing machine utilization and potentially lead to further job completions. Given the high proportion of unfinished jobs, running an additional 10 steps with this heuristic is likely to further optimize the schedule and reduce the makespan.\nDelta of current_makespan: 35\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 3\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Switching to \"shift_operator_109f\" aims to fine-tune the current schedule by exploring local shifts in operation sequencing. This can help achieve a more balanced workload distribution across machines, reduce idle times, and improve the overall makespan. Given the high standard deviation in job completion times, this heuristic could be particularly beneficial in addressing job diversity and optimizing machine utilization.\nDelta of current_makespan: -274\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The shift_operator_109f heuristic has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the makespan. Continuing with this approach is likely to further optimize the schedule by refining operation sequences and balancing machine workloads. Given the recent improvement, running additional steps may yield further reductions in the makespan and enhance overall efficiency.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The shift_operator_109f heuristic has previously demonstrated a significant reduction in the makespan, indicating its effectiveness in fine-tuning the current schedule. Given the current state, where the makespan has plateaued, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps could further optimize the schedule by refining operation sequences and balancing machine workloads. This approach aims to further reduce idle times and improve overall efficiency.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the plateau in makespan reduction with the shift_operator_109f heuristic, it indicates we might have reached a local optimum. However, since the shift_operator_109f previously demonstrated a significant makespan reduction, it could still be beneficial for further exploration to fine-tune the operation sequences. Running an additional 10 steps with this heuristic might help in identifying potential shifts that were previously missed, further balancing the workload and possibly reducing idle times.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The \"most_work_remaining_930e\" heuristic can help focus on advancing jobs with the highest remaining workload. This approach might complement the improvements made by the \"shift_operator_109f\" by addressing larger tasks that are contributing significantly to the makespan. By balancing the workload across machines and progressing these critical operations, we aim to optimize the overall schedule further.\nDelta of current_makespan: 84\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 5\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The \"most_work_remaining_930e\" heuristic has previously demonstrated its effectiveness by completing 5 jobs in the last round. Given that the makespan slightly increased, this suggests that there might still be potential for improvement by focusing on jobs with the most remaining work. Continuing with 10 more steps of this heuristic could help in further balancing the workload and advancing the completion of unfinished jobs, ultimately optimizing the schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: 74\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 6\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The \"most_work_remaining_930e\" heuristic has shown positive results in previous rounds, completing several jobs and making progress in reducing the makespan. Given that we are dealing with a fully scheduled solution where all jobs are finished, continuing with this heuristic can further fine-tune the remaining workload distribution and potentially reduce the makespan. Running an additional 10 steps can help ensure that larger tasks contributing to the makespan are effectively managed, optimizing the overall schedule further.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_work_remaining_930e. How does most_work_remaining_930e perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
