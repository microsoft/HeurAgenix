I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which falls under the broader category of combinatorial operation problems. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations, which can be efficiently addressed using heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms. The framework you've described, including the Solution class and various operators, aligns well with standard practices in tackling such problems using hyper-heuristics. Your approach to structuring the problem and operators seems appropriate for applying heuristic methods.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic in various scenarios involves understanding their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the nature of the specific Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) instances. Hereâs a breakdown of scenarios where each heuristic might be best suited:

1. **shift_operator_109f**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where local improvements are possible by simply rearranging operations within a machine's queue. Best for instances where minor adjustments can lead to significant improvements in the makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when the makespan is close to optimal, and the schedule needs fine-tuning.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:  
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for systems where short tasks need to be prioritized to quickly free up resources, leading to potentially reduced idle times for machines.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied in environments with many short-duration tasks, minimizing the waiting time for subsequent operations.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:  
   - **Scenario**: Suited for complex scheduling problems where larger-scale rearrangements of operations can significantly reduce the makespan.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for larger job sets where multiple operations can be re-sequenced to gain efficiency.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful when prioritizing jobs with the longest remaining time to minimize the impact of lengthy tasks on the overall schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Best when long-duration tasks dominate the schedule, aiming to reduce their bottleneck effect.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:  
   - **Scenario**: Applicable where swaps of non-adjacent operations can lead to a better sequence, particularly when initial schedules are not well-optimized.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for medium-sized problems where swapping pairs can reduce the makespan significantly.

6. **random_6512**:  
   - **Scenario**: Best for exploratory phases of scheduling or when the solution space is vast and complex, providing diverse potential solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Useful in very large or complex instances where traditional methods fail to escape local optima.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:  
   - **Scenario**: Effective when the focus is on jobs that, if completed, will significantly reduce the remaining workload.
   - **Quantification**: Best when there's a wide disparity in job durations, aiming to complete heavy workloads sooner.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where prioritizing long operations helps in resource management, ensuring that significant tasks are completed first.
   - **Quantification**: Best in settings where machine time is expensive, and long tasks need to be efficiently managed.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:  
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for systems where completing small jobs can quickly reduce the number of active jobs, simplifying the scheduling problem.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for instances with many small tasks that can be quickly completed to clear the schedule.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:  
    - **Scenario**: Ideal for environments where shorter jobs need to be prioritized to maximize throughput and minimize average job completion time.
    - **Quantification**: Best applied in settings with numerous short tasks, enhancing flow efficiency.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:  
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in scenarios where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over optimization, ensuring jobs are processed in the order they arrive.
    - **Quantification**: Useful in systems with low variability in job size and processing time, maintaining a straightforward queue.

These heuristics are often best applied in combination or as part of a larger hyper-heuristic approach, where different strategies are dynamically selected based on real-time analysis of the scheduling environment. This allows for adaptive and robust scheduling solutions across various industrial scenarios.
