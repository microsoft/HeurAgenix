I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding an optimal sequence or schedule from a finite set of possibilities. Heuristic algorithms, such as the ones you are developing with the described operators and framework, are commonly used to address such problems. Your framework, including the Solution class and various operators, seems well-structured for implementing and testing different heuristic approaches to JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,work_remaining,random_based,local_optimization

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on certain criteria like order of arrival or processing time.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

work_remaining: these heuristics focus on the remaining work, either selecting the job with most or least remaining work.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

random_based: this heuristic selects jobs randomly, which may not be powerful compared to others.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.

local_optimization: these heuristics attempt to optimize the schedule by making local changes such as swaps or shifts to improve the makespan.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:20
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[3, 4, 2, 0, 1], [1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0], [1, 2, 4, 0, 3], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 4, 3, 0], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 4, 3, 2], [0, 4, 2, 1, 3], [1, 4, 0, 3, 2], [3, 1, 0, 2, 4]]
job_operation_time:[[5, 58, 44, 9, 58], [89, 96, 97, 84, 77], [81, 85, 87, 39, 77], [15, 57, 73, 21, 31], [48, 71, 70, 40, 49], [10, 82, 34, 80, 22], [17, 55, 91, 75, 7], [47, 62, 72, 35, 11], [90, 94, 50, 64, 75], [15, 67, 12, 20, 71], [93, 29, 52, 57, 68], [77, 93, 58, 70, 7], [63, 27, 95, 6, 82], [36, 26, 48, 56, 87], [36, 8, 15, 76, 36], [78, 84, 41, 30, 76], [78, 75, 88, 13, 81], [54, 40, 13, 82, 29], [26, 82, 52, 6, 6], [54, 64, 54, 32, 88]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps, we should focus on the nature of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem and the characteristics of the provided dataset. The goal is to alternate between different heuristics during both the construction and improvement phases, leveraging their strengths at different stages of the problem-solving process. Here's a suggested guide:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Construction Phase

1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**
   - **When to Use:** Start with priority-based heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to quickly establish an initial schedule. These heuristics can provide a baseline solution that respects certain priorities or constraints.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Evaluate the initial performance of each priority-based heuristic.
     - Use heuristics that balance machine availability and job priority to avoid bottlenecks.
     - Monitor the makespan and adjust the heuristic if it fails to reduce it effectively.

2. **Work-Remaining Heuristics:**
   - **When to Use:** After establishing an initial schedule, switch to work-remaining heuristics like `least_work_remaining_66c9` to refine and balance the workload across machines.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Prioritize jobs with either the least or most work remaining depending on the initial makespan.
     - Use these heuristics to redistribute workload, aiming to minimize idle time on machines.

3. **Random-Based Heuristics:**
   - **When to Use:** Introduce randomness with `random_6512` to explore diverse scheduling possibilities and escape local optima.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Apply randomly only after priority-based and work-remaining heuristics.
     - Use randomness sparingly to maintain solution diversity and explore alternative solutions.

#### Improvement Phase

1. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**
   - **When to Use:** Once a reasonably good schedule is obtained, employ local optimization heuristics like `_2opt_f9c1`, `_3opt_6ee0`, and `shift_operator_109f`.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Focus on small, incremental changes that can improve the makespan without disrupting the overall schedule.
     - Identify potential swaps or shifts that reduce idle times and improve machine utilization.
     - Implement 2-opt or 3-opt swaps to explore potential improvements in the solution space.

2. **Adaptive Heuristics:**
   - **When to Use:** Continuously adapt the choice of heuristics based on the current solution status and performance metrics.
   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Use a combination of performance metrics (e.g., makespan reduction, machine utilization) to decide when to switch heuristics.
     - Employ a feedback loop to assess which heuristics are most effective at each stage and adjust the strategy accordingly.

### General Tips

- **Iterative Testing:** Continuously test the effectiveness of each heuristic in short runs, gather performance data, and refine the strategy.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use the statistical properties of the job operation times and machine utilization to inform heuristic choices.
- **Diversity in Approach:** Avoid relying solely on one heuristic category; each has its strengths and can contribute to a better overall solution when used strategically.

This strategic guide emphasizes a balanced approach, leveraging different heuristic categories during both the construction and improvement phases. By alternating between heuristics and adapting based on performance, you can build a robust solution that effectively addresses the complexities of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,work_remaining,random_based,local_optimization

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:priority_based
explanation:Since no operations have been scheduled yet and all jobs are unfinished, starting with a priority-based heuristic can help establish an initial schedule. This category will allow us to quickly set a baseline by prioritizing jobs based on criteria like order of arrival or processing time, which is crucial at the beginning of the scheduling process.
