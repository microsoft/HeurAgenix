In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine.

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nwork_remaining: these heuristics focus on the remaining work, either selecting the job with most or least remaining work.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP.

The goal is to alternate between different heuristics during both the construction and improvement phases, leveraging their strengths at different stages of the problem-solving process. Here's a suggested guide:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Use:** Start with priority-based heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to quickly establish an initial schedule. These heuristics can provide a baseline solution that respects certain priorities or constraints.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Evaluate the initial performance of each priority-based heuristic.\n     - Use heuristics that balance machine availability and job priority to avoid bottlenecks.\n     - Monitor the makespan and adjust the heuristic if it fails to reduce it effectively.\n\n2. **Work-Remaining Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Use:** After establishing an initial schedule, switch to work-remaining heuristics like `least_work_remaining_66c9` to refine and balance the workload across machines.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Prioritize jobs with either the least or most work remaining depending on the initial makespan.\n     - Use these heuristics to redistribute workload, aiming to minimize idle time on machines.\n\n3. **Random-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Use:** Introduce randomness with `random_6512` to explore diverse scheduling possibilities and escape local optima.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Apply randomly only after priority-based and work-remaining heuristics.\n     - Use randomness sparingly to maintain solution diversity and explore alternative solutions.\n\n#### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Use:** Once a reasonably good schedule is obtained, employ local optimization heuristics like `_2opt_f9c1`, `_3opt_6ee0`, and `shift_operator_109f`.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Focus on small, incremental changes that can improve the makespan without disrupting the overall schedule.\n     - Identify potential swaps or shifts that reduce idle times and improve machine utilization.\n     - Implement 2-opt or 3-opt swaps to explore potential improvements in the solution space.\n\n2. **Adaptive Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Use:** Continuously adapt the choice of heuristics based on the current solution status and performance metrics.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Use a combination of performance metrics (e.g., makespan reduction, machine utilization) to decide when to switch heuristics.\n     - Employ a feedback loop to assess which heuristics are most effective at each stage and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\n### General Tips\n\n- **Iterative Testing:** Continuously test the effectiveness of each heuristic in short runs, gather performance data, and refine the strategy.\n- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use the statistical properties of the job operation times and machine utilization to inform heuristic choices.\n- **Diversity in Approach:** Avoid relying solely on one heuristic category; each has its strengths and can contribute to a better overall solution when used strategically.\n\nThis strategic guide emphasizes a balanced approach, leveraging different heuristic categories during both the construction and improvement phases. By alternating between heuristics and adapting based on performance, you can build a robust solution that effectively addresses the complexities of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem."
