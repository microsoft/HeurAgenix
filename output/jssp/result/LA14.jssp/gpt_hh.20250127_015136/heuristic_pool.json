In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).\nA list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

operators:\nclass AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):\n    \"\"\"AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.\nThis operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.\nIt identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job

For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.\ndef most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\ndef first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP.

                "text": "Certainly! Here's an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic could be applicable, along with suggestions for quantifying these scenarios:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when the sequence of operations within a machine can be improved by reordering operations to minimize idle time or reduce the makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Look for machines with high idle times or significant gaps between operations. The effectiveness can be quantified by the reduction in makespan or idle time after applying the shift.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Best suited for situations where minimizing the waiting time of operations is crucial. It helps in quickly finishing smaller tasks to free up resources.\n   - **Quantification**: Measure by the average waiting time of jobs or the average completion time. Also, applicable in scenarios where jobs with short operations can lead to early availability of machines.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Useful when significant improvements can be achieved by complex reordering of operations, especially in dense schedules with many dependencies.\n   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the reduction in makespan or improvement in job completion times. Suitable for high-density schedules where local optima can be improved.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Effective when prioritizing jobs with longer processing times can help balance the load across machines.\n   - **Quantification**: Compare the makespan or load balancing metrics before and after application. Suitable in scenarios with high variance in job lengths.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Works well when small improvements in operation sequences can lead to a better overall schedule. \n   - **Quantification**: Calculate the improvement in makespan or reduction in total job completion times. Applicable where local swaps can lead to significant improvements.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Useful in exploratory phases where diverse solutions need to be sampled, particularly in stochastic or highly dynamic environments.\n   - **Quantification**: Track diversity in solutions or the variance in completion times. Useful for testing robustness or escaping local optima.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the most work left, making it suitable for schedules where bottlenecks are expected from large jobs.\n   - **Quantification**: Monitor the reduction in bottlenecks or the distribution of workload. Effective in scenarios with significant workload imbalances.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Best for scenarios where processing longer tasks first can optimize resource utilization and reduce idle times.\n   - **Quantification**: Measure the improvement in machine utilization or reduction in idle times. Suitable in environments with long critical tasks.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Applicable Scenario**: Effective when quickly completing jobs can significantly improve the overall schedule, especially in job-heavy environments.\n   - **Quantification**: Quantify by the number of jobs completed or the reduction in unfinished jobs. Applicable when quick job turnaround is prioritized.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Applicable Scenario**: Useful in scenarios where quickly clearing short jobs can lead to more flexibility in resource allocation.\n    - **Quantification**: Track the reduction in waiting times or increase in available slots for new jobs. Effective in environments with many short-duration jobs.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Applicable Scenario**: Suitable for environments where fairness or simplicity is prioritized over optimization, such as in real-time or online scheduling.\n    - **Quantification**: Compare the average waiting or response times. Best used when fairness or adherence to arrival order is critical.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific scenarios depending on the characteristics of the job shop environment, such as variability in job lengths, machine availability, or the importance of certain job attributes."
