I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations on machines, subject to constraints, to minimize a specific objective, such as makespan. Your framework with the `Solution` and `Operator` classes is appropriate for applying heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. The operators you've defined, such as `AdvanceOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSequenceOperator`, and `ShiftOperator`, are typical in heuristic search methods for combinatorial optimization problems. The standardized heuristic function signature also aligns well with the needs of such a problem.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable involves understanding the nature of the heuristic and the characteristics of the problem instance that make it suitable. Here's a breakdown of each heuristic and the scenarios where they might be most effective:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) with Dynamic Scoring (`shortest_processing_time_first_d471`)**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in scenarios where jobs have varying operation lengths, and minimizing the makespan is critical. It works well when shorter operations can be scheduled to fill gaps, reducing idle time on machines.
   - **Quantified**: High variance in operation times and a need for quick scheduling decisions to reduce idle machine time.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) with Dynamic Prioritization (`first_come_first_served_af26`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where fairness is crucial, and jobs are received in real-time. It is adaptable to dynamic changes in job sequences.
   - **Quantified**: Real-time job arrivals with moderate variability in processing times and a need for balancing fairness and efficiency.

3. **Most Work Remaining with Dynamic Scoring (`most_work_remaining_df20`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in situations where completing larger jobs earlier helps in freeing up resources and avoiding bottlenecks.
   - **Quantified**: High load jobs with a significant difference in total work content across jobs.

4. **Shift Operator (`shift_operator_109f`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used in finely-tuned schedules where small adjustments can lead to significant improvements in the makespan.
   - **Quantified**: Near-optimal solutions requiring slight modifications to reduce makespan, especially in balanced workload scenarios.

5. **3-opt Heuristic (`_3opt_6ee0`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for complex schedules where multiple swaps can lead to a significant reduction in makespan. It is effective when the initial solution is far from optimal.
   - **Quantified**: Complex schedules with potential for large improvements through multiple operation swaps.

6. **Longest Job Next (`longest_job_next_2e23`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where tackling the most time-consuming jobs first can help in avoiding long queues and potential delays.
   - **Quantified**: Scenarios with high variance in job lengths and a need to prioritize resource-intensive jobs early on.

7. **2-opt Heuristic (`_2opt_f9c1`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Best applied when a solution is close to optimal, and small swaps can potentially lead to improved scheduling.
   - **Quantified**: Near-optimal solutions where minor adjustments can help reduce the overall makespan.

8. **Random Selection (`random_6512`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in exploratory phases of scheduling where randomness can help in escaping local minima and exploring diverse solutions.
   - **Quantified**: Initial stages of scheduling or in highly dynamic environments requiring diverse solutions.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) (`longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`)**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where longer operations can be scheduled first to avoid them causing delays later in the sequence.
   - **Quantified**: High variance in operation times with critical long operations that need early scheduling.

10. **Least Work Remaining (`least_work_remaining_66c9`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios focused on quickly completing jobs to enhance throughput.
    - **Quantified**: Environments with many short jobs, aiming to increase job completion rate and reduce the number of unfinished jobs.

11. **Shortest Job Next (`shortest_job_next_5b42`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Useful in scenarios where quickly finishing smaller jobs can improve system responsiveness and reduce waiting times.
    - **Quantified**: High number of small jobs with a focus on improving flow efficiency and reducing waiting times.

These heuristics are best applied considering the specific problem characteristics, such as job size variance, real-time requirements, and the need for fairness or efficiency. Quantifying the scenarios involves understanding the distribution of job sizes, operation times, and the dynamic nature of job arrivals.
