I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "job_operation_sequence" (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.
    - "unfinished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all unfinished jobs.
    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which is a subset of combinatorial operation problems. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations across machines to minimize the makespan or other objectives. Heuristic algorithms are commonly employed to tackle such problems due to their complex search space and the NP-hard nature of JSSP. Your framework with Solution and Operator classes, along with the heuristic function signature, is aligned with solving combinatorial optimization problems like JSSP.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,work_remaining,work_intensive,adaptive,local_optimization

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as processing time or work remaining, making them suitable for scenarios where prioritization is crucial.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.

work_remaining: these heuristics focus on the remaining work of jobs, effective in optimizing jobs with variable workloads.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

work_intensive: these heuristics are tailored for scenarios where jobs with longer processing times need prioritization to optimize the overall schedule.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

adaptive: these heuristics incorporate dynamic elements like diversity or scoring mechanisms, making them adaptable to different dataset characteristics.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

local_optimization: these heuristics perform local optimizations through swaps or shifts, useful for scenarios requiring fine-tuning of existing solutions.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:20
machine_num:5
job_operation_sequence:[[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [2, 0, 3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 1, 0, 4], [1, 3, 2, 0, 4], [3, 1, 2, 4, 0], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 4, 2, 3, 1], [0, 3, 1, 2, 4], [3, 2, 4, 1, 0], [2, 1, 3, 4, 0], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1, 0], [4, 3, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [4, 3, 0, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), we need to consider both the construction and improvement phases. Here's a framework to help guide your decision-making process:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### 1. **Construction Phase**
This phase involves building an initial feasible solution. The goal is to quickly generate a solution that respects all constraints but may not be optimal.

- **Priority-Based Heuristics:**
  - **When to Use:** When you need an initial solution that respects specific job priorities or when certain jobs are critical.
  - **Execution Steps:** 
    - Start with `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish a baseline solution.
    - Evaluate performance briefly; if satisfactory, proceed to the improvement phase.
    - If not, switch to `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to potentially reduce initial makespan.

- **Work-Intensive Heuristics:**
  - **When to Use:** When jobs with longer processing times significantly impact the overall schedule.
  - **Execution Steps:**
    - Use `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` to ensure long jobs are appropriately scheduled early.
    - Assess makespan and adjust as needed before moving to improvement.

#### 2. **Improvement Phase**
This phase focuses on refining the initial solution to optimize the makespan or other objectives.

- **Local Optimization Heuristics:**
  - **When to Use:** When the initial solution is feasible but requires fine-tuning.
  - **Execution Steps:**
    - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` for small-scale improvements by swapping operations.
    - Use `_3opt_6ee0` for more extensive local optimization if `_2opt_f9c1` results are inadequate.

- **Adaptive Heuristics:**
  - **When to Use:** When the problem characteristics vary significantly, or you seek a more flexible approach.
  - **Execution Steps:**
    - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` to dynamically adjust based on current solution characteristics.
    - Alternate between adaptive heuristics and other categories to maintain solution diversity.

#### 3. **Iterative Process**
- **Heuristic Evaluation:**
  - After applying a heuristic, evaluate its performance based on makespan and other relevant metrics.
  - Use `validation_solution` to ensure that the new solution is valid.

- **Heuristic Switching:**
  - If a heuristic does not perform well, switch to another heuristic from a different category.
  - Alternate between construction and improvement heuristics to explore various solution spaces.

- **Diversity and Adaptation:**
  - Maintain a balance between exploiting known good heuristics and exploring new ones.
  - Use adaptive heuristics to incorporate learning from past iterations.

### Conclusion
The goal is to build a robust, flexible strategy that leverages the strengths of different heuristics while allowing for iterative experimentation and adaptation. By alternating between construction and improvement heuristics and switching as necessary, you can potentially reach a more optimal solution efficiently.
