In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\n\nwork_remaining: these heuristics focus on the remaining work of jobs, effective in optimizing jobs with variable workloads.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\n\nwork_intensive: these heuristics are tailored for scenarios where jobs with longer processing times need prioritization to optimize the overall schedule.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nadaptive: these heuristics incorporate dynamic elements like diversity or scoring mechanisms, making them adaptable to different dataset characteristics.\ndef first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets.

This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a framework to help guide your decision-making process:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### 1. **Construction Phase**\nThis phase involves building an initial feasible solution. The goal is to quickly generate a solution that respects all constraints but may not be optimal.\n\n- **Priority-Based Heuristics:**\n  - **When to Use:** When you need an initial solution that respects specific job priorities or when certain jobs are critical.\n  - **Execution Steps:** \n    - Start with `first_come_first_served_af26` to establish a baseline solution.\n    - Evaluate performance briefly; if satisfactory, proceed to the improvement phase.\n    - If not, switch to `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to potentially reduce initial makespan.\n\n- **Work-Intensive Heuristics:**\n  - **When to Use:** When jobs with longer processing times significantly impact the overall schedule.\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    - Use `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9` to ensure long jobs are appropriately scheduled early.\n    - Assess makespan and adjust as needed before moving to improvement.\n\n#### 2. **Improvement Phase**\nThis phase focuses on refining the initial solution to optimize the makespan or other objectives.\n\n- **Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n  - **When to Use:** When the initial solution is feasible but requires fine-tuning.\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` for small-scale improvements by swapping operations.\n    - Use `_3opt_6ee0` for more extensive local optimization if `_2opt_f9c1` results are inadequate.\n\n- **Adaptive Heuristics:**\n  - **When to Use:** When the problem characteristics vary significantly, or you seek a more flexible approach.\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` to dynamically adjust based on current solution characteristics.\n    - Alternate between adaptive heuristics and other categories to maintain solution diversity.\n\n#### 3. **Iterative Process**\n- **Heuristic Evaluation:**\n  - After applying a heuristic, evaluate its performance based on makespan and other relevant metrics.\n  - Use `validation_solution` to ensure that the new solution is valid.\n\n- **Heuristic Switching:**\n  - If a heuristic does not perform well, switch to another heuristic from a different category.\n  - Alternate between construction and improvement heuristics to explore various solution spaces.\n\n- **Diversity and Adaptation:**\n  - Maintain a balance between exploiting known good heuristics and exploring new ones.\n  - Use adaptive heuristics to incorporate learning from past iterations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe goal is to build a robust, flexible strategy that leverages the strengths of different heuristics while allowing for iterative experimentation and adaptation. By alternating between construction and improvement heuristics and switching as necessary, you can potentially reach a more optimal solution efficiently."
