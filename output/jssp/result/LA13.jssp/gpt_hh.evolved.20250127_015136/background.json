In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).\nA list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

operators:\nclass AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):\n    \"\"\"AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.\nThis operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.\nIt identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job
