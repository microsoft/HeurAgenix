I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id

        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations for jobs across machines, which is a classic example of combinatorial operations. The use of heuristics and hyper-heuristics, as described in your framework, is a common and effective approach for tackling such problems. Your solution and operator framework, along with the heuristic function signature, aligns well with typical strategies used in solving combinatorial optimization problems like JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable requires understanding the nature of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and how different heuristics can exploit specific problem characteristics to optimize scheduling. Here's an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic might be most effective:

1. **shortest_processing_time_first_d471**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when there is a high variance in processing times across jobs. Prioritizing shorter tasks can help in quickly freeing up machines for subsequent operations, potentially reducing bottlenecks.

2. **first_come_first_served_af26**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in environments where jobs arrive dynamically over time and need to be processed in the order they arrive. This heuristic is also suitable when minimizing the average waiting time for jobs is crucial.

3. **most_work_remaining_df20**:
   - **Scenario**: Best when the goal is to ensure long-term optimization by focusing on jobs that have the most remaining work. This is applicable in projects where completing longer jobs earlier can mitigate future scheduling conflicts.

4. **shift_operator_109f**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for fine-tuning an existing schedule. It is especially useful when a near-optimal schedule exists, and small adjustments can lead to significant improvements in makespan.

5. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for complex problems where the schedule needs significant restructuring. This heuristic attempts large-scale changes and is best when incremental improvements are insufficient.

6. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where longer jobs, if left till later, could create significant delays. Prioritizing them early can prevent potential bottlenecks.

7. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable for refining schedules by exploring swaps that can lead to a better sequence. It's beneficial when the job order is flexible, and minor adjustments can optimize the overall flow.

8. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or when exploring diverse scheduling scenarios. It can help in stochastic environments or when attempting to escape local optima in the search space.

9. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for environments where longer tasks, if not prioritized, could delay the overall completion time. It is especially useful when the processing time distribution is skewed.

10. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
    - **Scenario**: Effective in environments where clearing out shorter jobs can quickly reduce the queue and free up resources. It's ideal when there are many short tasks that can be completed rapidly.

11. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Applicable when minimizing the total completion time is critical, and there is a mix of short and long jobs. It helps in quickly processing jobs with shorter remaining times to optimize flow.

In summary, the choice of heuristic depends on specific problem characteristics like job processing time variance, arrival dynamics, and overall scheduling goals (e.g., minimizing makespan, balancing load, or reducing waiting time). Quantifying these scenarios typically involves analyzing the job processing time distribution, machine availability, and the desired scheduling objectives.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: most_work_remaining_df20. How does most_work_remaining_df20 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***Run heuristic:

Based on the provided data and the performance of the heuristics applied so far, it seems that the "most_work_remaining_df20" heuristic has been effective in prioritizing jobs with substantial remaining work, which helps in addressing bottlenecks and managing workflow efficiency. However, the recent rounds have shown diminishing returns, indicating that it might be reaching its limit in improving the makespan.

Given that the "shift_operator_109f" has previously helped in fine-tuning the schedule by addressing local inefficiencies, it might be beneficial to consider it again to make small adjustments that could lead to further improvements in the makespan without significantly increasing it.

Here's my recommendation:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shift_operator_109f
running steps: 10
explanation: The shift_operator_109f heuristic will focus on fine-tuning the schedule by optimizing the position of operations within machines. Given its past success in reducing the makespan, this heuristic could help address local inefficiencies and further improve the schedule.
