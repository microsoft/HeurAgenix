in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.\n\nwork_remaining: these heuristics evaluate jobs based on the remaining work or processing time to make scheduling decisions.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\n\nlocal_optimization: these heuristics attempt to improve the schedule by making local changes, such as swapping or shifting operations.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\n\nsimple_random: this heuristic uses a simple random selection of jobs, which is generally not as powerful as more structured approaches.\ndef random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.\n\nshortest_job_next: this heuristic focuses specifically on selecting jobs with the shortest remaining time for prioritization.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

A priority-based heuristic, such as First-Come-First-Served or Shortest Processing Time First, can help create a structured starting solution. This will provide a baseline from which further improvements and optimizations can be made.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->66\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since only one operation has been scheduled, and the current makespan is still very low with no jobs finished, it makes sense to continue building on the initial scheduling strategy. Continuing with a priority-based approach, specifically focusing on the shortest processing time, will help to systematically build a more structured schedule. This approach will ensure that we are gradually advancing jobs with the least processing time, potentially minimizing idle times and improving machine utilization as more operations are scheduled.\ncurrent_makespan: 66->95\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: work_remaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution where only two operations have been scheduled and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to switch to a heuristic category that evaluates the remaining work to better prioritize scheduling decisions. The \"work_remaining\" category can help focus on jobs that have a significant amount of work left, potentially balancing the workload across machines and minimizing idle times. This strategy might enhance the existing solution by addressing the current imbalance in job progression and machine utilization.\ncurrent_makespan: 95->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the current makespan is relatively high compared to the number of finished operations, it might be beneficial to switch back to a priority-based approach. The previous switch to \"work_remaining\" didn't yield significant improvements in terms of finished jobs. By focusing on a priority-based heuristic, particularly those targeting the shortest processing time or earliest completion, we can aim to reduce idle times and incrementally complete more jobs. This approach can help establish a more balanced schedule and potentially lower the makespan by prioritizing operations that can be completed quickly.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nHeuristic Category: work_remaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state where no jobs are finished and the makespan remains high, shifting focus to the \"work_remaining\" category could help address the imbalance in job progression. This approach prioritizes jobs with significant remaining work, potentially distributing the load more evenly across machines and reducing idle times. This strategy might enhance the existing solution by improving machine utilization and advancing unfinished jobs more effectively.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->5\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state where no jobs are finished and the makespan remains high, it's beneficial to focus on improving the existing schedule through local changes. The \"local_optimization\" category can help make targeted adjustments to the sequence of operations, potentially reducing idle times and increasing the overall efficiency of the schedule. By employing strategies like swaps or shifts, we can refine the current solution and aim to lower the makespan.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->5\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Despite the use of local optimization, the makespan has not improved, and no jobs have been completed. Returning to a priority-based approach can help refocus on advancing operations that might lead to faster job completion. Using a strategy like Shortest Processing Time First or Longest Processing Time First could help identify and prioritize critical operations that can be completed quickly, potentially reducing idle times and improving machine utilization. This can provide a structured path forward to enhance the current solution.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->6\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where no jobs have been completed and the makespan remains unchanged after several iterations of priority-based and work_remaining heuristics, it's beneficial to focus on local optimization. This category can help make precise adjustments to the sequence of operations, potentially reducing idle times and enhancing the overall efficiency of the schedule. By employing local optimization strategies like swaps or shifts, we can refine the current solution and aim to lower the makespan, which hasn't improved with previous approaches.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->6\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Despite attempts with local optimization, the makespan has remained unchanged, and no jobs have been completed. Returning to a priority-based approach, such as Shortest Job Next, may help to advance operations that can lead to job completions. Prioritizing jobs with shorter remaining times could help reduce idle times and improve machine utilization, providing a path to enhance the current solution.\ncurrent_makespan: 162->162\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 6->7\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nmachine_0: 3\nmachine_1: 0->1\nmachine_2: 8->7\nmachine_3: 1\nmachine_4: 2\n\nfinished_jobs:[]\nunfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\njob_operation_index:[1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\njob_last_operation_end_times:[66, 130, 88, 14, 0, 0, 0, 162, 95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nmachine_operation_index:[1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nmachine_last_operation_end_times:[14, 130, 162, 59, 88]\nfinished_operation_num:7\ncurrent_makespan:162\nnum_finished_jobs:0\nnum_unfinished_jobs:15\naverage_job_completion:37.0\nmax_job_completion_time:162\nmin_job_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_job_completion_time:54.117156860524986\naverage_machine_completion:90.6\nmax_machine_completion_time:162\nmin_machine_completion_time:14\nstd_dev_machine_completion_time:52.00615348206403\naverage_idle_time_per_machine:71.4\nproportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0\nproportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: shortest_processing_time_first_d471(priority_based). How it works?\nShould me:\n- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or\n- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nWe intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,work_remaining,local_optimization,simple_random,shortest_job_next\n\nThe response format is very important.\n1.
