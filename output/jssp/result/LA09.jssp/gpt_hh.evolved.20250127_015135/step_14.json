in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Here's an analysis of potential scenarios and quantifiable conditions for each heuristic:\n\n1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPT)**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best suited for environments where minimizing the average job completion time is a priority. It's useful when operations tend to have significantly different processing times.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the variance in operation times is high, and there's a need to reduce the overall job queue quickly.\n\n2. **First Come First Served (FCFS)**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for systems where fairness and predictability are important, such as in customer-facing environments.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in stable environments where job arrival times are critical, and processing times are relatively uniform.\n\n3. **Most Work Remaining**\n   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where jobs with extensive future operations need prioritization, perhaps to prevent bottlenecks later.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios with high variation in job lengths and when jobs with longer paths through the network are common.\n\n4. **Shift Operator**\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for improving existing schedules by making minor adjustments, especially when the schedule is near optimal but needs fine-tuning.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when minor changes can lead to significant improvements in makespan, typically in dense scheduling scenarios.\n\n5. **3-opt**\n   - **Scenario**: Best for tackling complex scheduling issues where local optimization is needed, and operations can be rearranged effectively.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the current schedule has many local suboptimal points and swapping can lead to a better global solution.\n\n6. **Longest Job Next**\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when it's important to clear out the longest jobs early to free up resources for smaller jobs.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the distribution of job lengths is heavily skewed, with a few long jobs dominating the schedule.\n\n7. **2-opt**\n   - **Scenario**: Works well for refining solutions by exploring possible pairwise operation swaps that could reduce the makespan.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the current solution has potential for significant improvement through local adjustments.\n\n8. **Random Selection**\n   - **Scenario**: Provides a baseline for comparison against more sophisticated heuristics and can be useful in exploratory stages or highly dynamic environments.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the system is highly unpredictable or when testing and learning are the goals.\n\n9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT)**\n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs with the longest individual operation times, useful in balancing the load among machines.\n   - **Quantification**: Best when operation times vary significantly, and there's a need to ensure machine utilization.\n\n10. **Least Work Remaining**\n    - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where it's beneficial to complete jobs quickly to reduce work-in-progress inventory.\n    - **Quantification**: Effective when minimizing the number of active jobs at any time is important for operational efficiency.\n\n11. **Shortest Job Next**\n    - **Scenario**: Ideal when system throughput and quick turnover are more critical than the completion time of longer jobs.\n    - **Quantification**: Applicable when the job environment consists of many small, quick tasks that need rapid completion.\n\nThese scenarios can be quantified by analyzing job and operation length distributions, variance in processing times, machine availability, and overall system goals.

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

Given that only one job is unfinished, additional steps may help finalize the schedule and further balance the load, potentially reducing the current makespan and optimizing the overall schedule.\n***"
