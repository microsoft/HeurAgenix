I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations for multiple jobs across several machines to minimize criteria like makespan, total completion time, or other metrics. Such problems are typically addressed using heuristic or metaheuristic approaches due to their complexity and the difficulty of solving them optimally in a reasonable time frame for large instances.

The framework you've outlined, including the Solution class and various operators (AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, ReverseSequenceOperator, ShiftOperator), is consistent with typical strategies for applying heuristic algorithms to JSSP. These operators allow for the manipulation of job sequences on machines, which is a common method for exploring the solution space in search of more optimal solutions.

The standardized heuristic function signature you've provided also aligns well with typical structures used in hyper-heuristic frameworks, where the heuristic needs to interact with both global and state data to make informed decisions about how to modify the solution.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) can help in identifying the best scenarios for their use. Here's an overview:

1. **shift_operator_109f**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where local adjustments can significantly impact the overall schedule efficiency. Best for fine-tuning near-optimal solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where small changes can lead to a notable decrease in makespan, particularly towards the end of scheduling where global changes are less effective.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for jobs with a wide variance in processing times. Prioritizing shorter tasks can help in minimizing idle machine times and balance the workload.
   - **Quantification**: Works well when the coefficient of variation for processing times is high.

3. **_3opt_6ee0**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when the current schedule is far from optimal, and there's room for substantial improvement. Effective in diverse and complex job sequences.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the solution space is large, and the initial solution is not close to optimal.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where longer jobs may cause significant delays if not scheduled early. Helps in reducing bottlenecks.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when the distribution of job lengths is skewed, with a few very long jobs.

5. **_2opt_f9c1**:
   - **Scenario**: Like the 3-opt heuristic, it's beneficial for improving an initial solution by exploring local changes. Best when the initial sequence has many inefficiencies.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there's a moderate improvement potential from local swaps.

6. **random_6512**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for introducing diversity in the solution search space. Can help in escaping local optima when integrated into larger metaheuristic frameworks.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for early-stage exploration or when the solution space is highly rugged.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs that could become future bottlenecks due to their large remaining workload. Helps in balancing the schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with uneven workload distribution among jobs.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:
   - **Scenario**: Similar to the Longest Job Next, it is suitable for minimizing machine idle time by scheduling longer operations first.
   - **Quantification**: Best when the processing time variance is high and longer operations are frequent.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:
   - **Scenario**: Aims at quickly completing jobs to reduce the number of unfinished jobs. Helps in environments where job completion is prioritized.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when rapid throughput is crucial, and there are many small jobs.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:
    - **Scenario**: Works best in environments where quick job turnover is essential. Prioritizes short jobs to minimize the number of active jobs.
    - **Quantification**: Suitable when the mean job length is low, and there are many short jobs.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:
    - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where fairness or simplicity is more important than optimization. Easy to implement and understand.
    - **Quantification**: Best in low-complexity scenarios or as a baseline for comparing more advanced heuristics.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific scenarios. The choice of heuristic depends on the problem's characteristics, such as job and processing time distributions, and the specific objectives of the scheduling task.

---Round 19---
Heuristic: random_6512
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Introducing randomness with random_6512 can help escape local optima and diversify the search space. This approach can potentially reveal new sequences that address current inefficiencies, especially given the stagnation in makespan improvement with _2opt_f9c1.

Delta of Finished Job Num: 3
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 20---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Returning to `shift_operator_109f` to refine local sequences post-random exploration, aiming to reduce the makespan and improve job completion balance. This heuristic has previously shown effectiveness in optimizing local sequences and should be revisited after the random heuristic's impact.

Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 21---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The shift_operator_109f heuristic has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in refining local sequences and reducing the makespan in previous rounds. Given the recent improvement in makespan and the current state, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is advisable to potentially achieve further optimization of local sequences and improve job completion balance.

Heuristic: shift_operator_109f
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Continuing with `shift_operator_109f` for 5 steps to further refine local sequences, as it has shown effectiveness in recent rounds. The smaller number of steps is chosen to cautiously explore any remaining optimization potential without excessive commitment.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current state and historical performance of the heuristics applied, here's an analysis to determine the next step:

- The `shift_operator_109f` heuristic has shown effectiveness in previous rounds for refining local sequences and reducing the makespan. However, in the last few rounds, it hasn't resulted in further improvements.
- The solution has seen stagnation with recent applications of `_2opt_f9c1` and `shift_operator_109f`.
- Introducing randomness with `random_6512` led to an increase in makespan but also completed some jobs, suggesting that the solution may benefit from further diversification.

Considering these factors, it might be beneficial to explore a more disruptive heuristic to potentially escape the current local optimum. I recommend using `random_6512` again to introduce more diversity into the solution space and then refine with `shift_operator_109f` if improvements are observed.

Here is the suggested course of action:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: random_6512
running steps: 10
explanation: Introducing randomness can help escape local optima and diversify the search space, potentially revealing new sequences that improve the current solution. Given the recent stagnation, this approach may lead to discovering more effective sequences, especially after improvements were seen in job completion last time it was used.
