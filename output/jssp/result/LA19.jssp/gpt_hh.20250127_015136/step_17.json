Such problems are typically addressed using heuristic or metaheuristic approaches due to their complexity and the difficulty of solving them optimally in a reasonable time frame for large instances.\n\nThe framework you've outlined, including the Solution class and various operators (AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, ReverseSequenceOperator, ShiftOperator), is consistent with typical strategies for applying heuristic algorithms to JSSP. These operators allow for the manipulation of job sequences on machines, which is a common method for exploring the solution space in search of more optimal solutions.\n\nThe standardized heuristic function signature you've provided also aligns well with typical structures used in hyper-heuristic frameworks, where the heuristic needs to interact with both global and state data to make informed decisions about how to modify the solution."

This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Here's an overview:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where local adjustments can significantly impact the overall schedule efficiency. Best for fine-tuning near-optimal solutions.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where small changes can lead to a notable decrease in makespan, particularly towards the end of scheduling where global changes are less effective.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for jobs with a wide variance in processing times. Prioritizing shorter tasks can help in minimizing idle machine times and balance the workload.\n   - **Quantification**: Works well when the coefficient of variation for processing times is high.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when the current schedule is far from optimal, and there's room for substantial improvement. Effective in diverse and complex job sequences.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the solution space is large, and the initial solution is not close to optimal.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where longer jobs may cause significant delays if not scheduled early. Helps in reducing bottlenecks.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the distribution of job lengths is skewed, with a few very long jobs.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Scenario**: Like the 3-opt heuristic, it's beneficial for improving an initial solution by exploring local changes. Best when the initial sequence has many inefficiencies.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there's a moderate improvement potential from local swaps.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful for introducing diversity in the solution search space. Can help in escaping local optima when integrated into larger metaheuristic frameworks.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for early-stage exploration or when the solution space is highly rugged.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs that could become future bottlenecks due to their large remaining workload. Helps in balancing the schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with uneven workload distribution among jobs.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to the Longest Job Next, it is suitable for minimizing machine idle time by scheduling longer operations first.\n   - **Quantification**: Best when the processing time variance is high and longer operations are frequent.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Aims at quickly completing jobs to reduce the number of unfinished jobs. Helps in environments where job completion is prioritized.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when rapid throughput is crucial, and there are many small jobs.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Scenario**: Works best in environments where quick job turnover is essential. Prioritizes short jobs to minimize the number of active jobs.\n    - **Quantification**: Suitable when the mean job length is low, and there are many short jobs.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where fairness or simplicity is more important than optimization. Easy to implement and understand.\n    - **Quantification**: Best in low-complexity scenarios or as a baseline for comparing more advanced heuristics.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific scenarios. The choice of heuristic depends on the problem's characteristics, such as job and processing time distributions, and the specific objectives of the scheduling task."

This approach aims to introduce more significant changes to the current solution, potentially reducing the makespan by overcoming local optima that previous heuristics could not address.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 14---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the lack of improvement from `_3opt_6ee0`, shifting back to `shift_operator_109f` is recommended to refine local sequences and potentially reduce the makespan further, as it was effective in previous rounds.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 15---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Continue with shift_operator_109f for a few more steps to attempt further optimization of local sequences, as it has shown effectiveness in previous rounds. If no improvement, consider switching to another heuristic.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 16---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_930e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Switching to `most_work_remaining_930e` aims to address potential bottlenecks by focusing on jobs with the most remaining work, which could help balance the workload and reduce the makespan, given the current stagnation in improvement.\nDelta of current_makespan: 148\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 10\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_work_remaining_930e. How does most_work_remaining_930e perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
