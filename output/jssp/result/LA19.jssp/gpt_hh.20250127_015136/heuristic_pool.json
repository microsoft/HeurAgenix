In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations for multiple jobs across several machines to minimize criteria like makespan, total completion time, or other metrics. Such problems are typically addressed using heuristic or metaheuristic approaches due to their complexity and the difficulty of solving them optimally in a reasonable time frame for large instances.\n\nThe framework you've outlined, including the Solution class and various operators (AdvanceOperator, SwapOperator, ReverseSequenceOperator, ShiftOperator), is consistent with typical strategies for applying heuristic algorithms to JSSP. These operators allow for the manipulation of job sequences on machines, which is a common method for exploring the solution space in search of more optimal solutions.\n\nThe standardized heuristic function signature you've provided also aligns well with typical structures used in hyper-heuristic frameworks, where the heuristic needs to interact with both global and state data to make informed decisions about how to modify the solution."

The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.\ndef _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Here's an overview:\n\n1. **shift_operator_109f**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful in situations where local adjustments can significantly impact the overall schedule efficiency. Best for fine-tuning near-optimal solutions.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where small changes can lead to a notable decrease in makespan, particularly towards the end of scheduling where global changes are less effective.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for jobs with a wide variance in processing times. Prioritizing shorter tasks can help in minimizing idle machine times and balance the workload.\n   - **Quantification**: Works well when the coefficient of variation for processing times is high.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful when the current schedule is far from optimal, and there's room for substantial improvement. Effective in diverse and complex job sequences.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the solution space is large, and the initial solution is not close to optimal.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where longer jobs may cause significant delays if not scheduled early. Helps in reducing bottlenecks.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when the distribution of job lengths is skewed, with a few very long jobs.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1**:\n   - **Scenario**: Like the 3-opt heuristic, it's beneficial for improving an initial solution by exploring local changes. Best when the initial sequence has many inefficiencies.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there's a moderate improvement potential from local swaps.\n\n6. **random_6512**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful for introducing diversity in the solution search space. Can help in escaping local optima when integrated into larger metaheuristic frameworks.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for early-stage exploration or when the solution space is highly rugged.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e**:\n   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes jobs that could become future bottlenecks due to their large remaining workload. Helps in balancing the schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with uneven workload distribution among jobs.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to the Longest Job Next, it is suitable for minimizing machine idle time by scheduling longer operations first.\n   - **Quantification**: Best when the processing time variance is high and longer operations are frequent.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9**:\n   - **Scenario**: Aims at quickly completing jobs to reduce the number of unfinished jobs. Helps in environments where job completion is prioritized.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective when rapid throughput is crucial, and there are many small jobs.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42**:\n    - **Scenario**: Works best in environments where quick job turnover is essential. Prioritizes short jobs to minimize the number of active jobs.\n    - **Quantification**: Suitable when the mean job length is low, and there are many short jobs.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f**:\n    - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where fairness or simplicity is more important than optimization. Easy to implement and understand.\n    - **Quantification**: Best in low-complexity scenarios or as a baseline for comparing more advanced heuristics.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for specific scenarios. The choice of heuristic depends on the problem's characteristics, such as job and processing time distributions, and the specific objectives of the scheduling task."
