I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making a sequence of decisions, such as which job to schedule next on which machine, in order to optimize a certain objective, typically minimizing the makespan. The framework you've described, including the Solution and Operator classes, aligns with the structure needed to apply heuristic methods to solve such problems. Heuristics are well-suited for JSSP because they can effectively navigate the large solution space to find good solutions within a reasonable time frame.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable involves understanding the nature of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic. Each heuristic might perform better in certain conditions depending on factors like job size, processing times, machine availability, and overall complexity of the scheduling environment. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) - `shortest_processing_time_first_d471`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Works well when the goal is to minimize the average completion time or when jobs have relatively similar processing times. It tends to perform well in environments with low variability in processing times.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Average job completion time and variance in job processing times.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - `first_come_first_served_af26`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for environments where fairness and simplicity are prioritized. It can be effective in systems where jobs arrive randomly over time.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Job arrival times and order compliance.

3. **Most Work Remaining - `most_work_remaining_df20`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when dealing with jobs with significantly different total processing requirements. It prioritizes jobs that could become bottlenecks if delayed.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Total remaining work or processing time for each job.

4. **Shift Operator - `shift_operator_109f`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful in fine-tuning schedules to reduce makespan, especially in tightly packed schedules where minor adjustments can lead to improvements.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Makespan improvements after local adjustments.

5. **3-opt Heuristic - `_3opt_6ee0`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective in complex scheduling environments where exploring multiple swap possibilities can yield better solutions.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Reduction in makespan and solution quality improvement metrics.

6. **Longest Job Next - `longest_job_next_2e23`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable when longer jobs are likely to create bottlenecks if not scheduled earlier, helping to balance load across the schedule.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Total processing time of jobs and potential bottleneck analysis.

7. **2-opt Heuristic - `_2opt_f9c1`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful in exploring and optimizing schedules by improving the order of operations, particularly in schedules that are already near-optimal.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Improvement in sequence efficiency and reduction in makespan.

8. **Random Selection - `random_6512`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful as a baseline or in highly dynamic environments where unpredictability is inherent or when exploring diverse potential solutions.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Diversity of solutions and robustness to changes.

9. **Longest Processing Time First - `longest_processing_time_first_9dc9`**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Works well in environments where long processing times are a significant factor and need to be front-loaded to prevent delays.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Processing time distributions and potential delay impacts.

10. **Least Work Remaining - `least_work_remaining_66c9`**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when minimizing the total completion time and where shorter jobs can be completed quickly to free up resources.
    - **Best Quantified By**: Total remaining processing time and resource utilization.

11. **Shortest Job Next - `shortest_job_next_5b42`**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Similar to SPT, effective for minimizing average waiting time and in environments where shorter jobs are frequent.
    - **Best Quantified By**: Job completion times and average waiting time.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited to particular characteristics of the scheduling problem. The key to applying these heuristics effectively lies in understanding the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.

Before this discuss, we have already 9 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the initial stage of the scheduling problem with no operations started, and considering the data provided, starting with the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic can help in quickly identifying and scheduling operations that have shorter processing times, potentially leading to a balanced and efficient initial schedule. This approach is particularly useful in the initial stages to minimize the time waiting for longer operations and to start filling up machine queues effectively.
Delta of current_makespan: 101
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_processing_time_first_d471
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state data, the Shortest Processing Time First heuristic has already been applied in the initial round, contributing to the advancement of 10 operations. Since we are at the early stages of scheduling with a makespan of 101 and no jobs completed yet, continuing with the SPT heuristic for another 10 steps could further optimize the initial scheduling. This approach will help balance the machine queues by advancing operations with shorter processing times, potentially leading to a more efficient distribution of tasks across machines and improving the current makespan.

Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 2---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Switching to the Most Work Remaining heuristic aims to address potential bottlenecks by advancing jobs with the most processing time left. This approach can balance the workload, potentially leading to job completions and a reduction in the current makespan.
Delta of current_makespan: 93
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 9
---Round 3---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The "least_work_remaining_66c9" heuristic is chosen to focus on completing jobs with the least amount of work left. This approach can help in achieving job completions, potentially reducing the makespan more effectively and improving overall machine utilization. By completing jobs, the system can reduce complexity and clear machine queues, potentially leading to a more efficient schedule.
Delta of current_makespan: 207
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 10
---Round 4---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Continuing with the "least_work_remaining_66c9" heuristic as it has successfully completed a job and may help in completing more. Running it for a few more steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness in further reducing the makespan and increasing job completions. If limited improvement is observed, a strategy shift might be considered.
Delta of current_makespan: 158
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 5---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The "least_work_remaining_66c9" heuristic has shown progress in completing jobs and reducing the makespan in the previous rounds. Continuing with this heuristic for another 5 steps may result in further job completions and an improved makespan. This approach focuses on minimizing the remaining work, which aligns with the goal of reducing the current makespan and increasing job throughput. If limited improvement is observed after this execution, we may consider shifting strategies to address other aspects of the scheduling problem.
Delta of current_makespan: 165
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 5
---Round 6---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Switching to "most_work_remaining_df20" can help balance the workload by advancing jobs with more work left, potentially reducing future bottlenecks and improving overall schedule efficiency.
Delta of current_makespan: -76
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 9
---Round 7---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The "most_work_remaining_df20" heuristic showed a reduction in the makespan in the last round, indicating its potential to balance the workload effectively by advancing jobs with significant processing time left. Given the current state, this heuristic could continue to mitigate potential bottlenecks and further optimize the schedule. Running it for another 10 steps should provide a clearer picture of its impact on the current solution. If improvements are observed, we might consider continuing with this approach or reassessing based on the updated state.
Delta of current_makespan: 74
Delta of Finished Job Num: 1
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 9
---Round 8---
Heuristic: shift_operator_109f

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the data provided and the previous rounds of heuristic applications, we need to decide whether to continue with the current heuristic or switch to another. The last heuristic applied was the `shift_operator_109f`, which resulted in a significant reduction in the makespan (-126). This indicates that the shift operator is effectively optimizing the schedule by rearranging operations within machine queues.

Considering the current state of the solution, continuing with the `shift_operator_109f` for a few more steps could further enhance the schedule. The operator has shown potential for reducing the makespan significantly, suggesting that there might still be room for improvement in the current sequence.

Therefore, my recommendation is as follows:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shift_operator_109f
running steps: 5
explanation: The shift operator has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the makespan by rearranging operations. Continuing with this heuristic for an additional 5 steps could leverage its optimization potential further, potentially resulting in a more efficient schedule. This approach aims to consolidate the gains achieved in the previous round and explore additional improvements in the operation sequence.
