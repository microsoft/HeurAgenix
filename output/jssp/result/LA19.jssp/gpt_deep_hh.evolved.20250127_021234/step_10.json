In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions.

Here's a suggested framework:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n- **Objective**: Quickly construct a feasible initial solution that provides a baseline for further improvements.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Priority-Based**: Use these to establish a basic order of operations. Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to ensure a straightforward, feasible schedule.\n  - **Shortest Job Next**: Implement `shortest_job_next_5b42` to quickly construct a schedule that favors short tasks, reducing initial makespan.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Apply a priority-based heuristic to set initial job priorities.\n  2. Test with a shortest job next heuristic to adjust the schedule slightly for better initial performance.\n  3. Evaluate the performance of the constructed solution and record key metrics (e.g., makespan, machine utilization).\n\n#### Phase 2: Initial Solution Evaluation\n- **Objective**: Assess the quality of the initial solution and identify improvement areas.\n- **Suggested Actions**:\n  - Calculate key performance metrics (e.g., makespan, job completion times).\n  - Identify bottlenecks and machines with high utilization.\n\n#### Phase 3: Solution Improvement\n- **Objective**: Incrementally improve the initial solution using local optimizations and dynamic adjustments.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Local Optimization**: Focus on improving the schedule using `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to perform small adjustments that can lead to significant improvements.\n  - **Dynamic Scoring**: Use `most_work_remaining_df20` to adaptively prioritize jobs that influence the overall schedule positively.\n  - **Work Remaining**: Consider `least_work_remaining_66c9` to focus on jobs that can be completed quickly, freeing up resources.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Apply local optimization heuristics to fine-tune the operation sequence on each machine.\n  2. Use dynamic scoring to adapt the schedule based on real-time performance data.\n  3. Experiment with work remaining heuristics to explore alternative job priorities.\n\n#### Phase 4: Iterative Improvement and Exploration\n- **Objective**: Alternate between heuristics to explore the solution space effectively and ensure convergence to a high-quality solution.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **All Categories**: Rotate between different categories to prevent stagnation and explore diverse solutions.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Implement a cyclical or adaptive approach to switch between different heuristic categories based on current solution performance.\n  2. Periodically reassess and compare performance metrics to decide the next heuristic to apply.\n  3. Record the performance of each heuristic iteration for analysis and future reference.\n\n### General Considerations\n- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to switch heuristics if performance stagnates.\n- **Diversity**: Use a variety of heuristics to cover different aspects of the scheduling problem.\n- **Performance Tracking**: Maintain records of performance metrics across iterations to identify trends and successful strategies.\n\nThis guide emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, allowing for iterative testing and refinement of different heuristic approaches to find the most effective solution strategy for the JSSP."

Starting with a priority-based heuristic like first_come_first_served_af26 can help quickly establish an initial sequence of operations, providing a foundation to build upon. This approach will enable us to move from a completely unscheduled state to a baseline schedule, which can then be evaluated and improved further.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->44\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9\nHeuristic Category: work_remaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The initial heuristic established a basic operation sequence, but progress is still minimal with only one operation scheduled. Switching to the work_remaining category, specifically using the least_work_remaining_66c9 heuristic, can help prioritize jobs that can be completed quickly. This approach aims to advance jobs with fewer remaining operations, potentially freeing up machine resources and improving overall machine utilization. This shift could lead to faster short-term gains in the schedule and reduce idle times, helping to build momentum in the initial solution development.\ncurrent_makespan: 44->44\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: first_come_first_served_af26\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_scoring\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution has only progressed slightly, with two operations scheduled and no jobs completed. While the work_remaining heuristic helped prioritize jobs with the least work, the current makespan remains unchanged. Switching to the dynamic_scoring category could provide a more adaptive approach, leveraging real-time data to adjust priorities dynamically. This might improve the schedule's efficiency by considering factors like machine availability and alignment with the optimal trajectory, thus potentially enhancing the current solution's development.\ncurrent_makespan: 44->46\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: work_remaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  While the dynamic scoring heuristic has made slight progress, the current makespan and the number of finished operations indicate that the solution is still in its early stages. Returning to the work_remaining category, specifically using a heuristic like least_work_remaining_66c9, could help prioritize jobs that can be completed quickly. This approach aims to advance jobs with fewer remaining operations, potentially freeing up machine resources and improving overall machine utilization. By focusing on work remaining, we can target immediate gains in scheduling efficiency and build momentum in solution development.\ncurrent_makespan: 46->82\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 3->4\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has shown progress in terms of scheduled operations, but the overall makespan and job completion metrics suggest room for significant improvement. Given that we have already explored priority-based, work_remaining, and dynamic_scoring categories, shifting focus to local_optimization could help refine the schedule. Local optimization heuristics like `_2opt_f9c1` can make incremental improvements by adjusting the sequence of operations, potentially reducing idle times and improving makespan. This approach can enhance the efficiency of the current solution by fine-tuning the operation order on machines.\ncurrent_makespan: 82->82\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->4\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has not improved in terms of makespan or finished operations since the last round, indicating that the local adjustments made by the `_3opt_6ee0` heuristic might require further iterations to yield visible improvements. Continuing with local optimization could help refine the sequence of operations further, potentially reducing idle times and enhancing the makespan. This approach allows us to make incremental improvements by fine-tuning the operation order, which can be beneficial given the current state of the schedule.\ncurrent_makespan: 82->82\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->4\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: most_work_remaining_df20\nHeuristic Category: work_remaining\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution is in the early stages, with no jobs fully completed and a high makespan. The local optimization heuristics have not yet shown improvement in terms of makespan or completed operations. Returning to the work_remaining category can help prioritize jobs that can be completed quickly, potentially freeing up machine resources and reducing idle times. This approach might help in building momentum by advancing jobs with fewer remaining operations, leading to faster short-term gains and setting a better foundation for future optimization efforts.\ncurrent_makespan: 82->104\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 4->5\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution's progress is minimal, with only a few operations scheduled and a high makespan. The repeated application of work_remaining heuristics hasn't significantly improved the solution, suggesting that further iterations in this category may not provide the desired results. Switching to local_optimization could help refine the operation sequence, potentially reducing idle times and improving the makespan. Local optimization techniques like `_2opt_f9c1` and `_3opt_6ee0` can make incremental adjustments that may lead to visible improvements in the current solution, given its early stage of development. This approach can fine-tune the operation order, which is crucial at this point to enhance scheduling efficiency.\ncurrent_makespan: 104->104\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->5\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution has not significantly progressed, with high makespan and no completed jobs. Given the early stage of development and limited improvements from recent local optimization efforts, revisiting a priority-based heuristic can help establish a more structured initial order of operations. A priority-based approach might provide a clearer foundation to build upon by aligning the sequence with job priorities, potentially unlocking opportunities for future optimizations as the schedule evolves.\ncurrent_makespan: 104->104\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->6\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: _3opt_6ee0\nHeuristic Category: local_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has not progressed significantly, with a high makespan and no jobs completed.
