I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "job_operation_time" (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "finished_jobs" (list[int]): List of all finished jobs.

    - "job_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each job.
    - "job_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each job in current solution.
    - "machine_operation_index" (list[int]): The index of the next operation to be scheduled for each machine.
    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be effectively tackled using heuristics. Your framework involving solutions and operators is well-suited for applying various heuristic algorithms to explore the solution space and optimize scheduling. The data structures and operators you described appear appropriate for manipulating and evaluating potential solutions to the JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user
We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,local_optimization,work_remaining,dynamic_scoring,shortest_job_next

priority_based: These heuristics prioritize jobs based on specific criteria such as arrival time, remaining work, processing time, or total job length.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_optimization: These heuristics focus on local optimizations by swapping or shifting operations to minimize makespan or improve the schedule incrementally.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.

work_remaining: These heuristics evaluate jobs based on the remaining work or operations, prioritizing either the least or most work remaining.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

dynamic_scoring: These heuristics incorporate dynamic scoring mechanisms to adaptively prioritize jobs based on current solution characteristics and potential improvements.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.

shortest_job_next: These heuristics prioritize jobs with the shortest total remaining processing time or next operation time.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:10
job_operation_sequence:[[2, 3, 5, 4, 0, 7, 8, 9, 1, 6], [4, 7, 1, 8, 0, 3, 2, 5, 9, 6], [9, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0, 8, 2, 7, 5], [1, 2, 7, 5, 8, 4, 3, 6, 9, 0], [6, 1, 3, 0, 2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5], [7, 5, 8, 2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 9, 0], [6, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 0], [0, 5, 8, 9, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 1], [5, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0], [9, 4, 6, 7, 0, 2, 8, 5, 3, 1]]
job_operation_time:[[44, 5, 58, 97, 9, 84, 77, 96, 58, 89], [15, 31, 87, 57, 77, 85, 81, 39, 73, 21], [82, 22, 10, 70, 49, 40, 34, 48, 80, 71], [91, 17, 62, 75, 47, 11, 7, 72, 35, 55], [71, 90, 75, 64, 94, 15, 12, 67, 20, 50], [70, 93, 77, 29, 58, 93, 68, 57, 7, 52], [87, 63, 26, 6, 82, 27, 56, 48, 36, 95], [36, 15, 41, 78, 76, 84, 30, 76, 36, 8], [88, 81, 13, 82, 54, 13, 29, 40, 78, 75], [88, 54, 64, 32, 52, 6, 54, 82, 6, 26]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves understanding the different phases of solving the problem and how different heuristics can be applied effectively in each phase. Here's a suggested framework:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective**: Quickly construct a feasible initial solution that provides a baseline for further improvements.
- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Priority-Based**: Use these to establish a basic order of operations. Start with heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to ensure a straightforward, feasible schedule.
  - **Shortest Job Next**: Implement `shortest_job_next_5b42` to quickly construct a schedule that favors short tasks, reducing initial makespan.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Apply a priority-based heuristic to set initial job priorities.
  2. Test with a shortest job next heuristic to adjust the schedule slightly for better initial performance.
  3. Evaluate the performance of the constructed solution and record key metrics (e.g., makespan, machine utilization).

#### Phase 2: Initial Solution Evaluation
- **Objective**: Assess the quality of the initial solution and identify improvement areas.
- **Suggested Actions**:
  - Calculate key performance metrics (e.g., makespan, job completion times).
  - Identify bottlenecks and machines with high utilization.

#### Phase 3: Solution Improvement
- **Objective**: Incrementally improve the initial solution using local optimizations and dynamic adjustments.
- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Local Optimization**: Focus on improving the schedule using `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to perform small adjustments that can lead to significant improvements.
  - **Dynamic Scoring**: Use `most_work_remaining_df20` to adaptively prioritize jobs that influence the overall schedule positively.
  - **Work Remaining**: Consider `least_work_remaining_66c9` to focus on jobs that can be completed quickly, freeing up resources.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Apply local optimization heuristics to fine-tune the operation sequence on each machine.
  2. Use dynamic scoring to adapt the schedule based on real-time performance data.
  3. Experiment with work remaining heuristics to explore alternative job priorities.

#### Phase 4: Iterative Improvement and Exploration
- **Objective**: Alternate between heuristics to explore the solution space effectively and ensure convergence to a high-quality solution.
- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:
  - **All Categories**: Rotate between different categories to prevent stagnation and explore diverse solutions.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Implement a cyclical or adaptive approach to switch between different heuristic categories based on current solution performance.
  2. Periodically reassess and compare performance metrics to decide the next heuristic to apply.
  3. Record the performance of each heuristic iteration for analysis and future reference.

### General Considerations
- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to switch heuristics if performance stagnates.
- **Diversity**: Use a variety of heuristics to cover different aspects of the scheduling problem.
- **Performance Tracking**: Maintain records of performance metrics across iterations to identify trends and successful strategies.

This guide emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, allowing for iterative testing and refinement of different heuristic approaches to find the most effective solution strategy for the JSSP.

Before this discuss, we have already 4 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The initial solution phase has not progressed, as no operations have been scheduled yet. Starting with a priority-based heuristic like first_come_first_served_af26 can help quickly establish an initial sequence of operations, providing a foundation to build upon. This approach will enable us to move from a completely unscheduled state to a baseline schedule, which can then be evaluated and improved further.
current_makespan: 0->44
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Heuristic Category: work_remaining
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The initial heuristic established a basic operation sequence, but progress is still minimal with only one operation scheduled. Switching to the work_remaining category, specifically using the least_work_remaining_66c9 heuristic, can help prioritize jobs that can be completed quickly. This approach aims to advance jobs with fewer remaining operations, potentially freeing up machine resources and improving overall machine utilization. This shift could lead to faster short-term gains in the schedule and reduce idle times, helping to build momentum in the initial solution development.
current_makespan: 44->44
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: first_come_first_served_af26
Heuristic Category: dynamic_scoring
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current solution has only progressed slightly, with two operations scheduled and no jobs completed. While the work_remaining heuristic helped prioritize jobs with the least work, the current makespan remains unchanged. Switching to the dynamic_scoring category could provide a more adaptive approach, leveraging real-time data to adjust priorities dynamically. This might improve the schedule's efficiency by considering factors like machine availability and alignment with the optimal trajectory, thus potentially enhancing the current solution's development.
current_makespan: 44->46
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: most_work_remaining_df20
Heuristic Category: work_remaining
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  While the dynamic scoring heuristic has made slight progress, the current makespan and the number of finished operations indicate that the solution is still in its early stages. Returning to the work_remaining category, specifically using a heuristic like least_work_remaining_66c9, could help prioritize jobs that can be completed quickly. This approach aims to advance jobs with fewer remaining operations, potentially freeing up machine resources and improving overall machine utilization. By focusing on work remaining, we can target immediate gains in scheduling efficiency and build momentum in solution development.
current_makespan: 46->82
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->4

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: most_work_remaining_df20(work_remaining). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,local_optimization,work_remaining,dynamic_scoring,shortest_job_next

The response format is very important.

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(priority_based,local_optimization,work_remaining,dynamic_scoring,shortest_job_next)
explanation:xxx

2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:local_optimization
explanation: The current solution has shown progress in terms of scheduled operations, but the overall makespan and job completion metrics suggest room for significant improvement. Given that we have already explored priority-based, work_remaining, and dynamic_scoring categories, shifting focus to local_optimization could help refine the schedule. Local optimization heuristics like `_2opt_f9c1` can make incremental improvements by adjusting the sequence of operations, potentially reducing idle times and improving makespan. This approach can enhance the efficiency of the current solution by fine-tuning the operation order on machines.
