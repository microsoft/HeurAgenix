I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves finding an optimal order and assignment of operations across machines to minimize certain objectives like makespan, total completion time, or lateness. Heuristics are commonly used to tackle such problems due to their complexity and the large search space involved. Your framework with the Solution and Operator classes, along with the heuristic function signature, appears to be a suitable approach for applying heuristic algorithms to solve JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic involves understanding the characteristics of the job shop scheduling problem instances where each heuristic might perform well. Here's a breakdown of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) - d471**:  
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in environments where minimizing the waiting time of short tasks can lead to an overall reduction in makespan. It's particularly useful when there are many short jobs interspersed with a few long ones.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with a high variance in processing times, where short tasks are numerous.

2. **First Come First Served (FCFS) - af26**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful in systems where fairness and simplicity are priorities, or when job arrival times are staggered in a way that early arriving jobs have a significant impact on resource allocation.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with staggered job arrivals and where the order of arrival correlates with processing efficiency.

3. **Most Work Remaining (MWR) - df20**:  
   - **Scenario**: Best for instances where longer jobs need to be prioritized to avoid them becoming bottlenecks later in the schedule.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with a significant number of long jobs that could potentially delay the completion of other jobs if not scheduled early.

4. **Shift Operator - 109f**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful in fine-tuning near-optimal schedules where small adjustments can lead to significant improvements.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances where the initial solution is close to optimal, but local improvements could further reduce makespan.

5. **3-opt - 6ee0**:  
   - **Scenario**: Effective in complex instances where multiple swaps can significantly improve the schedule. It is useful when a more aggressive local search is needed.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with high interdependencies between job operations that can benefit from extensive reordering.

6. **Longest Job Next (LJN) - 2e23**:  
   - **Scenario**: Useful in scenarios where long jobs, if delayed, can severely impact the completion time of the schedule.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with a few very long jobs among many shorter ones.

7. **2-opt - f9c1**:  
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for instances where minor swaps can lead to a more optimal job sequence. It's a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with moderate complexity where jobs can be swapped without violating constraints.

8. **Random - 6512**:  
   - **Scenario**: Acts as a baseline or for diversification in metaheuristic algorithms, providing random exploration of the solution space.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances where exploration is needed to escape local optima, or as a comparative baseline.

9. **Longest Processing Time First (LPT) - 9dc9**:  
   - **Scenario**: Prioritizes heavy jobs, making it suitable for instances where the longer jobs are critical to minimizing overall delays.
   - **Quantified by**: Instances with a few dominating long jobs that need early scheduling to avoid bottlenecks.

10. **Least Work Remaining (LWR) - 66c9**:  
    - **Scenario**: Effective in reducing the number of unfinished jobs quickly, particularly useful when nearing the end of a scheduling period.
    - **Quantified by**: Instances where the number of jobs is high, but individual job length is short.

11. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) - 5b42**:  
    - **Scenario**: Suitable for environments where completing jobs quickly is more beneficial, particularly in high-throughput or high-turnover environments.
    - **Quantified by**: Instances with a large number of small jobs where throughput is prioritized.

Each heuristic's applicability depends on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, such as job length, number of jobs, variance in processing times, and machine availability. Understanding these factors helps in choosing the right heuristic for a given scenario.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shift_operator_109f. How does shift_operator_109f perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shift_operator_109f
running steps: 10
hype parameter(optional): None
explanation: The Shift Operator has demonstrated potential in making local improvements to the schedule, as evidenced by a reduction in makespan in the previous round. Given that all jobs are finished and the makespan is already relatively optimized, continuing with the Shift Operator for another 10 steps could further fine-tune the solution by optimizing the order of operations within machine queues. This approach aims to achieve incremental improvements towards the optimal solution.
