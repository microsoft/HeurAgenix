In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

Useful when the current schedule is near-optimal and only minor tweaks are needed.\n   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the potential improvement in makespan by testing shifts across different machines and positions.\n\n2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best when operations with shorter processing times are prioritized to minimize idle time on machines, often effective in systems with high variability in operation durations.\n   - **Quantification**: Compare average processing times and identify jobs with minimal operation times to gauge effectiveness.\n\n3. **_3opt_6ee0()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for complex job sequences where multiple swaps can lead to significant improvements, especially when local optima need to be escaped.\n   - **Quantification**: Measure the number of successful swaps that reduce makespan and the resulting improvement percentage.\n\n4. **longest_job_next_2e23()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Works well in environments where longer jobs can cause bottlenecks if not scheduled early. Prioritizing these can help balance the workload.\n   - **Quantification**: Calculate the remaining processing time and assess the impact on makespan when longer jobs are scheduled earlier.\n\n5. **_2opt_f9c1()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when the solution is suboptimal due to poor sequencing and non-adjacent swaps can lead to a more efficient schedule.\n   - **Quantification**: Track improvements in makespan after non-adjacent swaps and the overall number of swaps made.\n\n6. **random_6512()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or in highly dynamic environments where randomness can help explore new solution spaces.\n   - **Quantification**: Measure variance in makespan and identify any unexpected improvements due to random scheduling.\n\n7. **most_work_remaining_930e()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for situations where jobs with significant remaining work can cause delays; prioritizing them can lead to a balanced workload.\n   - **Quantification**: Calculate the total remaining work and assess the reduction in makespan when these jobs are prioritized.\n\n8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable when longer operations need to be scheduled to prevent future bottlenecks, ensuring machines are utilized efficiently.\n   - **Quantification**: Evaluate scheduling outcomes by comparing processing times and resulting idle times on machines.\n\n9. **least_work_remaining_66c9()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when minimizing the number of unfinished jobs quickly is a priority, especially in systems with limited resources.\n   - **Quantification**: Track the completion rate of jobs and the impact on overall makespan.\n\n10. **shortest_job_next_5b42()**:\n    - **Scenario**: Works best when quick turnover of jobs is necessary, reducing the queue of unfinished jobs rapidly.\n    - **Quantification**: Measure job completion times and the effect on machine utilization rates.\n\n11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f()**:\n    - **Scenario**: Applicable in systems where fairness or order of arrival is critical, often used in less complex environments or as a baseline.\n    - **Quantification**: Compare makespan with other heuristics to gauge performance in maintaining order versus efficiency.\n\nBy analyzing these scenarios and quantifying the performance of each heuristic, you can determine the most suitable approach for a given instance of the JSSP, potentially combining heuristics for more robust solutions."

Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution.

Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
