in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order

This heuristic has previously shown both significant positive and negative impacts on the makespan. Given the potential for substantial improvement, it's worth testing its effectiveness with 5 more steps to see if it can further refine the current solution. This approach allows us to assess its impact while minimizing risk.\nDelta of current_makespan: -91\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Given the potential for fine-tuning with \"shift_operator_109f\" and the mixed results observed previously, a short run of 5 steps can help assess its current impact. This allows for careful evaluation of any improvements while minimizing risk, especially since the solution is already close to completion with all jobs finished.\nDelta of current_makespan: -23\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 14---\nHeuristic: shift_operator_109f\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Given the recent mixed but mostly positive impact on the makespan, running \"shift_operator_109f\" for 5 additional steps allows us to further explore its potential for refining the schedule. This approach balances the risk of negative impacts with the potential for further improvements, given that all jobs are finished and the solution is near-completion.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 15---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Attempting a short run of the 2-opt heuristic to explore potential refinements in the sequence that could lead to slight improvements in the makespan. This is to address any remaining inefficiencies in the completed schedule.\nDelta of current_makespan: -125\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n---Round 16---\nHeuristic: _2opt_f9c1\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Continuing with `_2opt_f9c1` as it recently showed a reduction in makespan. Running it for an additional 5 steps to explore further refinements in the sequence and potentially decrease the makespan further.\nDelta of current_makespan: 0\nDelta of Finished Job Num: 0\nDelta of Finished Operation Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: _2opt_f9c1. How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
