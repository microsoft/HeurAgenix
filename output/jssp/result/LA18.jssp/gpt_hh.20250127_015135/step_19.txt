I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2] = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence and allocation of jobs to machines, which is a combinatorial challenge due to the factorial growth of possible solutions with the number of jobs and machines. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve such problems because they can provide good solutions within a reasonable time frame, even if they may not always find the optimal solution. Your framework, which involves defining a solution space and operators to explore that space, is well-suited for applying heuristic algorithms to tackle the JSSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.
def shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def random_6512(): This heuristic randomly selects an unfinished job and advances its next operation in the job's processing sequence.
def most_work_remaining_930e(): Most Work Remaining heuristic for JSSP. Selects the unfinished job with the maximum remaining work (total processing time of remaining operations) and returns an AdvanceOperator for that job to proceed with the next operation in sequence.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.
def first_come_first_served_6c4f(): Implement the First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic schedules the jobs in the order they arrive, without considering their processing times or other characteristics.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing scenarios for each heuristic in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is crucial for understanding their potential effectiveness. Here’s a breakdown of scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable and how they can be quantified:

1. **shift_operator_109f()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when small adjustments in the sequence of operations can lead to significant improvements in makespan. Useful when the current schedule is near-optimal and only minor tweaks are needed.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the potential improvement in makespan by testing shifts across different machines and positions.

2. **shortest_processing_time_first_c374()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best when operations with shorter processing times are prioritized to minimize idle time on machines, often effective in systems with high variability in operation durations.
   - **Quantification**: Compare average processing times and identify jobs with minimal operation times to gauge effectiveness.

3. **_3opt_6ee0()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for complex job sequences where multiple swaps can lead to significant improvements, especially when local optima need to be escaped.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the number of successful swaps that reduce makespan and the resulting improvement percentage.

4. **longest_job_next_2e23()**:
   - **Scenario**: Works well in environments where longer jobs can cause bottlenecks if not scheduled early. Prioritizing these can help balance the workload.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate the remaining processing time and assess the impact on makespan when longer jobs are scheduled earlier.

5. **_2opt_f9c1()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when the solution is suboptimal due to poor sequencing and non-adjacent swaps can lead to a more efficient schedule.
   - **Quantification**: Track improvements in makespan after non-adjacent swaps and the overall number of swaps made.

6. **random_6512()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or in highly dynamic environments where randomness can help explore new solution spaces.
   - **Quantification**: Measure variance in makespan and identify any unexpected improvements due to random scheduling.

7. **most_work_remaining_930e()**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for situations where jobs with significant remaining work can cause delays; prioritizing them can lead to a balanced workload.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate the total remaining work and assess the reduction in makespan when these jobs are prioritized.

8. **longest_processing_time_first_9dc9()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable when longer operations need to be scheduled to prevent future bottlenecks, ensuring machines are utilized efficiently.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate scheduling outcomes by comparing processing times and resulting idle times on machines.

9. **least_work_remaining_66c9()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when minimizing the number of unfinished jobs quickly is a priority, especially in systems with limited resources.
   - **Quantification**: Track the completion rate of jobs and the impact on overall makespan.

10. **shortest_job_next_5b42()**:
    - **Scenario**: Works best when quick turnover of jobs is necessary, reducing the queue of unfinished jobs rapidly.
    - **Quantification**: Measure job completion times and the effect on machine utilization rates.

11. **first_come_first_served_6c4f()**:
    - **Scenario**: Applicable in systems where fairness or order of arrival is critical, often used in less complex environments or as a baseline.
    - **Quantification**: Compare makespan with other heuristics to gauge performance in maintaining order versus efficiency.

By analyzing these scenarios and quantifying the performance of each heuristic, you can determine the most suitable approach for a given instance of the JSSP, potentially combining heuristics for more robust solutions.

Explain: The recent application of the `_2opt_f9c1` heuristic showed a reduction in makespan, indicating potential for further refinement. Continuing with this heuristic for an additional 5 steps allows us to explore more opportunities for improving the sequence and decreasing makespan, especially given that the solution is near optimal with all jobs finished.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0
---Round 18---
Heuristic: _2opt_f9c1
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Continuing with `_2opt_f9c1` as it recently showed a reduction in makespan, suggesting potential for further optimization. Running for 5 additional steps allows for careful exploration of any remaining refinements in the sequence while minimizing the risk of negative impacts.
Delta of current_makespan: 0
Delta of Finished Job Num: 0
Delta of Finished Operation Num: 0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_f9c1. How does _2opt_f9c1 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
