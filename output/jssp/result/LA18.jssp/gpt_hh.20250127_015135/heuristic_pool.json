In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution

of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.\nEach job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.\nEach sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).\nEach job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.\nJob matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]],

It involves finding an optimal sequence and allocation of jobs to machines, which is a combinatorial challenge due to the factorial growth of possible solutions with the number of jobs and machines. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve such problems because they can provide good solutions within a reasonable time frame, even if they may not always find the optimal solution. Your framework, which involves defining a solution space and operators to explore that space, is well-suited for applying heuristic algorithms to tackle the JSSP."

The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_c374(): Implements the Shortest Processing Time first heuristic for the JSSP. This heuristic selects the unfinished job with the shortest next operation processing time and uses an AdvanceOperator to schedule it on the corresponding machine.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
