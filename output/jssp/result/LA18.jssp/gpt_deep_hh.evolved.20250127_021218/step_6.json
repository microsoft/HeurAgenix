This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.\ndef shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.\ndef least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.\ndef shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.\n\ndynamic_scheduling: these heuristics dynamically evaluate jobs and make decisions based on current system state, often considering factors like job length or work remaining.\ndef most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.\ndef longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP.

This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.\ndef _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions.

The strategy can be divided into two main phases: Construction Phase and Improvement Phase.\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n**Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution quickly.  \n**Approach:** Use a combination of priority-based and dynamic scheduling heuristics to construct an initial schedule.\n\n1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**\n   - Start with basic heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to get a quick initial layout.\n   - Evaluate the impact of these heuristics on the makespan and adjust priorities based on job characteristics (e.g., `least_work_remaining_66c9` or `shortest_job_next_5b42`).\n\n2. **Dynamic Scheduling Heuristics:**\n   - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` or `longest_job_next_2e23` to dynamically adjust the schedule based on current system state.\n   - These heuristics can identify bottlenecks and redistribute workload, providing flexibility during initial construction.\n\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Run each selected heuristic briefly (e.g., a few iterations) to gauge its performance.\n   - Use performance metrics (e.g., makespan, machine utilization) to evaluate effectiveness.\n   - Switch heuristics if necessary, based on performance feedback.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n**Objective:** Refine the initial solution to minimize the makespan and improve efficiency.  \n**Approach:** Utilize local optimization heuristics for fine-tuning and targeted adjustments.\n\n1. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**\n   - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to make small swaps and observe improvements in makespan.\n   - Use `shift_operator_109f` to explore different operation sequences within machine queues.\n\n2. **Iterative Refinement:**\n   - Continuously evaluate the impact of local changes on the overall schedule.\n   - Iteratively apply combinations of swaps and shifts to explore potential improvements.\n\n3. **Execution Steps:**\n   - Cycle through different local optimization strategies to prevent stagnation in local optima.\n   - Evaluate performance after each set of iterations and adjust strategies accordingly.\n   - Use a combination of visualization and metrics to assess changes and guide further adjustments.\n\n### General Strategy\n\n- **Alternation:** Regularly switch between heuristic categories to avoid reliance on a single approach and to explore diverse solution spaces.\n- **Evaluation:** After each heuristic run, evaluate its impact on key performance indicators, such as makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.\n- **Adaptation:** Be prepared to adapt strategies based on real-time performance data, iteratively refining the approach as needed.\n\nBy alternating between construction and improvement heuristics and evaluating their effectiveness iteratively, you can build a robust framework for solving JSSP and adapt to the specific characteristics of the problem instance at hand. This strategic guide aims to balance exploration and exploitation, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories at various phases of the solution process."

Priority-based heuristics are well-suited for this phase as they can quickly prioritize jobs based on criteria like processing time or work remaining, providing a structured starting point for further optimization. Implementing a heuristic like 'first_come_first_served_af26' or 'shortest_processing_time_first_d471' will help establish a baseline schedule to build upon.\ncurrent_makespan: 0->54\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42\nHeuristic Category: priority_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has just begun with only one operation scheduled, and no jobs have been completed yet. Continuing with the priority-based heuristic category will help build a more robust initial schedule by leveraging criteria such as work remaining or processing time. This phase is crucial to establishing a strong foundation before transitioning to more dynamic scheduling or local optimization techniques. Utilizing another priority-based heuristic can further populate the schedule effectively and set the stage for subsequent optimization.\ncurrent_makespan: 54->54\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_scheduling\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The initial solution is still in its early stages, with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed. While priority-based heuristics have provided a starting point, switching to dynamic scheduling could help adapt to the current state of the system. Dynamic scheduling heuristics, like `most_work_remaining_df20` or `longest_job_next_2e23`, can evaluate the current system state and guide the scheduling of operations based on factors such as machine availability and workload distribution. This approach will allow for more responsive adjustments to the schedule, potentially improving the makespan and overall solution quality at this stage.\ncurrent_makespan: 54->141\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 2->3\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: longest_job_next_2e23\nHeuristic Category: dynamic_scheduling\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution is still in its early stages, with only three operations scheduled and no completed jobs.

These heuristics can help prioritize operations that might have been overlooked in the dynamic scheduling phase. By focusing on priority-based approaches like `least_work_remaining_66c9` or `shortest_job_next_5b42`, we can address any imbalances in workload distribution and potentially kickstart job completions, thus improving the makespan and overall solution efficiency.\ncurrent_makespan: 141->141\nFinished Job Num: 0->0\nFinished Operation Num: 5->6\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nmachine_0: 0\nmachine_1: 6\nmachine_2: \nmachine_3: 1->4\nmachine_4: 2\nmachine_5: \nmachine_6: 0\nmachine_7: \nmachine_8: \nmachine_9: \n\nfinished_jobs:[]\nunfinished_jobs:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\njob_operation_index:[2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\njob_last_operation_end_times:[141, 20, 45, 0, 103, 0, 73, 0, 0, 0]\nmachine_operation_index:[1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nmachine_last_operation_end_times:[141, 73, 0, 103, 45, 0, 54, 0, 0, 0]\nfinished_operation_num:6\ncurrent_makespan:141\nnum_finished_jobs:0\nnum_unfinished_jobs:10\naverage_job_completion:38.2\nmax_job_completion_time:141\nmin_job_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_job_completion_time:48.632910667571615\naverage_machine_completion:41.6\nmax_machine_completion_time:141\nmin_machine_completion_time:0\nstd_dev_machine_completion_time:48.42974292725494\naverage_idle_time_per_machine:99.4\nproportion_of_finished_jobs:0.0\nproportion_of_unfinished_jobs:1.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: least_work_remaining_66c9(priority_based).

Local optimization heuristics can make small, targeted adjustments to the current solution, potentially leading to improvements in the makespan and overall job completion. By using local optimization strategies like `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f`, we can refine the schedule and address inefficiencies that have not been captured by priority-based or dynamic scheduling heuristics.\n***"
