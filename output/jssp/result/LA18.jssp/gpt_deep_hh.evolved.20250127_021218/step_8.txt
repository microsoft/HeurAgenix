I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swaps two operations in corresponding jobs in the same machine's."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id1: int, job_id2: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id1 = job_id1
        self.job_id2 = job_id2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        index1 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id1)
        index2 = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id2)
        (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2]) = (new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index2], new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][index1])
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ReverseSequenceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a sequence of operations in corresponding jobs within a machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, start_position: int, end_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.start_position = start_position
        self.end_position = end_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        sequence = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1]
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id][self.start_position:self.end_position + 1] = sequence[::-1]
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)
class ShiftOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Shifts an operation to a new position within the same machine's queue."""
    def __init__(self, machine_id: int, job_id: int, new_position: int):
        self.machine_id = machine_id
        self.job_id = job_id
        self.new_position = new_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        current_position = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].index(self.job_id)
        operation = new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].pop(current_position)
        new_job_sequences[self.machine_id].insert(self.new_position, operation)
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, solution.job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "job_num" (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - "machine_num" (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:

    - "machine_last_operation_end_times" (list[int]): The end time of the last operation for each machine, also as the available time for next operation.
    - "current_makespan" (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal order of operations across a set of machines to minimize a given objective, such as makespan or total completion time. Heuristic algorithms are commonly used to solve JSSP due to the problem's complexity and NP-hard nature. Your framework with a Solution class and various Operator classes is well-aligned with typical approaches to addressing such problems using heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): priority_based,dynamic_scheduling,local_optimization

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize jobs based on certain criteria like arrival time, processing time, or work remaining.
def first_come_first_served_af26(): Enhanced First Come First Served (FCFS) heuristic to dynamically prioritize jobs based on immediate impact and adapt to diverse datasets. This heuristic introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism to balance alignment with the positive solution trajectory, machine availability, and dataset-specific characteristics.
def shortest_processing_time_first_d471(): Shortest Processing Time First with Dynamic Scoring Heuristic for JSSP. This heuristic dynamically evaluates unfinished jobs based on their next operation's machine availability, alignment with the optimal trajectory, and a bias factor to guide towards jobs that minimize makespan.
def least_work_remaining_66c9(): Selects the job with the least total processing time remaining from the unfinished jobs and returns an AdvanceOperator to schedule its next operation.
def shortest_job_next_5b42(): Implements the Shortest Job Next heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. This heuristic chooses the unfinished job with the shortest remaining processing time and advances its next operation.

dynamic_scheduling: these heuristics dynamically evaluate jobs and make decisions based on current system state, often considering factors like job length or work remaining.
def most_work_remaining_df20(): Most Work Remaining Heuristic with Dynamic Scoring and Local Optimization for JSSP.
def longest_job_next_2e23(): Longest Job Next heuristic for JSSP. Prioritizes the job with the longest total processing time remaining. It uses the AdvanceOperator to schedule the next operation for the job with the maximum remaining processing time.
def longest_processing_time_first_9dc9(): Selects the next job to be scheduled based on the Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic.

local_optimization: these heuristics focus on local optimization techniques to improve the schedule by making small changes like swaps or shifts.
def _2opt_f9c1(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This heuristic attempts to reduce the makespan by swapping two non-adjacent operations in the schedule. It iteratively checks all possible pairs of operations to determine if a shorter sequence can be found.
def _3opt_6ee0(): 3-opt heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). This function does not generate a complete 3-opt operator since JSSP requires operations within a job to be executed in sequence and does not allow reordering of these operations.The heuristic is adapted to generate a series of 2-opt swaps (using the SwapOperator) which approximate a 3-opt move.
def shift_operator_109f(): This heuristic attempts to find a better schedule by shifting an operation within the same machine's queue. For each machine, it tries shifting each operation to all possible positions and evaluates the makespan. The shift that results in the best improvement (reduction in makespan) is selected.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
job_num:10
machine_num:10
job_operation_sequence:[[6, 0, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 5, 2, 9], [3, 9, 6, 5, 0, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1], [4, 1, 8, 0, 7, 6, 5, 3, 9, 2], [9, 1, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 0, 7, 5], [3, 2, 6, 9, 7, 0, 4, 5, 1, 8], [1, 4, 0, 2, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5, 3], [1, 3, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 4, 6, 5], [5, 3, 6, 1, 0, 7, 8, 9, 2, 4], [1, 0, 7, 4, 3, 5, 9, 8, 6, 2], [4, 8, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 5, 0]]
job_operation_time:[[54, 87, 48, 60, 39, 35, 72, 95, 66, 5], [20, 46, 34, 55, 97, 19, 59, 21, 37, 46], [45, 24, 28, 28, 83, 78, 23, 25, 5, 73], [12, 37, 38, 71, 33, 12, 55, 53, 87, 29], [83, 49, 23, 27, 65, 48, 90, 7, 40, 17], [66, 25, 62, 84, 13, 64, 46, 59, 19, 85], [73, 80, 41, 53, 47, 57, 74, 14, 67, 88], [64, 84, 46, 78, 84, 26, 28, 52, 41, 63], [11, 64, 67, 85, 10, 73, 38, 95, 97, 17], [60, 32, 95, 93, 65, 85, 43, 85, 46, 59]]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), it's essential to consider the problem's dynamic nature and the strengths of each heuristic category. The strategy can be divided into two main phases: Construction Phase and Improvement Phase.

### Construction Phase

**Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution quickly.  
**Approach:** Use a combination of priority-based and dynamic scheduling heuristics to construct an initial schedule.

1. **Priority-Based Heuristics:**
   - Start with basic heuristics like `first_come_first_served_af26` or `shortest_processing_time_first_d471` to get a quick initial layout.
   - Evaluate the impact of these heuristics on the makespan and adjust priorities based on job characteristics (e.g., `least_work_remaining_66c9` or `shortest_job_next_5b42`).

2. **Dynamic Scheduling Heuristics:**
   - Implement `most_work_remaining_df20` or `longest_job_next_2e23` to dynamically adjust the schedule based on current system state.
   - These heuristics can identify bottlenecks and redistribute workload, providing flexibility during initial construction.

3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Run each selected heuristic briefly (e.g., a few iterations) to gauge its performance.
   - Use performance metrics (e.g., makespan, machine utilization) to evaluate effectiveness.
   - Switch heuristics if necessary, based on performance feedback.

### Improvement Phase

**Objective:** Refine the initial solution to minimize the makespan and improve efficiency.  
**Approach:** Utilize local optimization heuristics for fine-tuning and targeted adjustments.

1. **Local Optimization Heuristics:**
   - Apply `_2opt_f9c1` or `_3opt_6ee0` to make small swaps and observe improvements in makespan.
   - Use `shift_operator_109f` to explore different operation sequences within machine queues.

2. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Continuously evaluate the impact of local changes on the overall schedule.
   - Iteratively apply combinations of swaps and shifts to explore potential improvements.

3. **Execution Steps:**
   - Cycle through different local optimization strategies to prevent stagnation in local optima.
   - Evaluate performance after each set of iterations and adjust strategies accordingly.
   - Use a combination of visualization and metrics to assess changes and guide further adjustments.

### General Strategy

- **Alternation:** Regularly switch between heuristic categories to avoid reliance on a single approach and to explore diverse solution spaces.
- **Evaluation:** After each heuristic run, evaluate its impact on key performance indicators, such as makespan, machine utilization, and job completion times.
- **Adaptation:** Be prepared to adapt strategies based on real-time performance data, iteratively refining the approach as needed.

By alternating between construction and improvement heuristics and evaluating their effectiveness iteratively, you can build a robust framework for solving JSSP and adapt to the specific characteristics of the problem instance at hand. This strategic guide aims to balance exploration and exploitation, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories at various phases of the solution process.

Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:

machine_num:10
job_operation_sequence:[[6, 0, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 5, 2, 9], [3, 9, 6, 5, 0, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1], [4, 1, 8, 0, 7, 6, 5, 3, 9, 2], [9, 1, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 0, 7, 5], [3, 2, 6, 9, 7, 0, 4, 5, 1, 8], [1, 4, 0, 2, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5, 3], [1, 3, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 4, 6, 5], [5, 3, 6, 1, 0, 7, 8, 9, 2, 4], [1, 0, 7, 4, 3, 5, 9, 8, 6, 2], [4, 8, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 5, 0]]

Before this discuss, we have already 8 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since the current solution has no operations scheduled yet, it is essential to build an initial feasible solution. Priority-based heuristics are well-suited for this phase as they can quickly prioritize jobs based on criteria like processing time or work remaining, providing a structured starting point for further optimization. Implementing a heuristic like 'first_come_first_served_af26' or 'shortest_processing_time_first_d471' will help establish a baseline schedule to build upon.
current_makespan: 0->54
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_job_next_5b42
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has just begun with only one operation scheduled, and no jobs have been completed yet. Continuing with the priority-based heuristic category will help build a more robust initial schedule by leveraging criteria such as work remaining or processing time. This phase is crucial to establishing a strong foundation before transitioning to more dynamic scheduling or local optimization techniques. Utilizing another priority-based heuristic can further populate the schedule effectively and set the stage for subsequent optimization.
current_makespan: 54->54
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: longest_processing_time_first_9dc9
Heuristic Category: dynamic_scheduling
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The initial solution is still in its early stages, with only two operations scheduled and no jobs completed. While priority-based heuristics have provided a starting point, switching to dynamic scheduling could help adapt to the current state of the system. Dynamic scheduling heuristics, like `most_work_remaining_df20` or `longest_job_next_2e23`, can evaluate the current system state and guide the scheduling of operations based on factors such as machine availability and workload distribution. This approach will allow for more responsive adjustments to the schedule, potentially improving the makespan and overall solution quality at this stage.
current_makespan: 54->141
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: dynamic_scheduling
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current solution is still in its early stages, with only three operations scheduled and no completed jobs. Dynamic scheduling heuristics can help adapt to the current system state, addressing machine availability and workload distribution more effectively. Continuing with dynamic scheduling will allow for responsive adjustments to the schedule, potentially improving the makespan and overall solution quality. This approach will help balance the workload across machines and better utilize available resources.
current_makespan: 141->141
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 3->4
---Round 4---
Heuristic: longest_job_next_2e23
Heuristic Category: dynamic_scheduling
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where only a few operations are scheduled and no jobs are completed, dynamic scheduling heuristics are well-suited to adapt to the system's current state. Continuing with dynamic scheduling will allow for more responsive adjustments, potentially improving the makespan and balancing workload distribution. This approach can better utilize available resources and address machine availability, leading to a more efficient schedule at this stage.
current_makespan: 141->141
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 4->5
---Round 5---
Heuristic: least_work_remaining_66c9
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the current makespan has not improved over the last few iterations and no jobs have been completed, it would be strategic to revisit priority-based heuristics. These heuristics can help prioritize operations that might have been overlooked in the dynamic scheduling phase. By focusing on priority-based approaches like `least_work_remaining_66c9` or `shortest_job_next_5b42`, we can address any imbalances in workload distribution and potentially kickstart job completions, thus improving the makespan and overall solution efficiency.
current_makespan: 141->141
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 5->6
---Round 6---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given that the current makespan has not improved significantly over the last few iterations and no jobs have been completed, it may be beneficial to focus on local optimization techniques. Local optimization heuristics can make small, targeted adjustments to the current solution, potentially leading to improvements in the makespan and overall job completion. By using local optimization strategies like `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f`, we can refine the schedule and address inefficiencies that have not been captured by priority-based or dynamic scheduling heuristics.
current_makespan: 141->141
Finished Job Num: 0->0
Finished Operation Num: 6->6
---Round 7---
Heuristic: _3opt_6ee0
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where no jobs have been completed and the makespan has not improved significantly, continuing with local optimization seems appropriate. Local optimization can help make targeted adjustments to improve efficiency. Since the `_3opt_6ee0` heuristic was just applied, exploring other local optimization strategies like `_2opt_f9c1` or `shift_operator_109f` could help further refine the schedule and potentially reduce the makespan. These techniques can address inefficiencies that previous heuristics might have missed, providing a more balanced workload distribution across machines.

The last heuristic category is: _3opt_6ee0(local_optimization). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: priority_based,dynamic_scheduling,local_optimization

explanation: The current makespan has not improved significantly over the past few iterations, and no jobs have been completed, indicating potential inefficiencies in the current schedule. While local optimization can make targeted adjustments, it may not be sufficient to address broader scheduling issues. Switching to dynamic scheduling can provide more adaptive strategies to rebalance the workload across machines and utilize available resources more effectively. This approach can help identify and alleviate bottlenecks that are preventing progress, potentially improving the makespan and advancing job completion.
