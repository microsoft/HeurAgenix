I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of nodes in the problem.
    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the most efficient way to route vehicles to serve a set of customers with known demands, without exceeding the capacity constraints of the vehicles. This problem is typically solved using heuristic methods due to its NP-hard nature, meaning that exact solutions are computationally intensive for large instances. The framework you described with the Solution and Operator classes is a suitable approach for applying heuristic algorithms to tackle this problem.

In this instance, I have developed a heuristic function, although its performance has not reached a satisfactory level. My goal is to learn from case studies to improve and optimize this heuristic. To achieve this, I will provide the following:
1. The heuristic function code.
2. Test data for evaluation.
3. Negative solution from heuristic function.

Please based on the data and solution, help to pick out the bottleneck operations in negative solution, which may cause the poor performance
Please note:
1. Some operations, although they appear different, are essentially the same.
2. Some operations may lead to solutions that look different but are essentially the same.
3. Some operations may cause changes to the solution but do not affect the final cost; these are not considered bottlenecks.
4. When an operation A is performed poorly, leading to a series of subsequent operations experiencing issues, we consider the first operation A to be a bottleneck.
5. If there is only one item, there is no need to force multiple answers.
6. Try to propose a better operator than origin one and you can learn from positive solution or others.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***bottleneck_operations:
5; InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4); Inserting node 8 after node 4 would more closely resemble the positive solution, potentially leading to a lower overall cost.
6; InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=4, position=5); Inserting node 4 before node 2 would align better with the positive solution, offering a more compact and efficient route.

Now focus on this operator InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=1) in step 5.

The state before InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=1) is:
current_solution:
vehicle_0: 0->6->3->2->7->1->0
vehicle_1: 0->0
vehicle_2: 0->0

visited_nodes:[0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
visited_num:6
unvisited_nodes:[4, 5, 8, 9]
unvisited_num:4
total_current_cost:175.0
last_visited:[0, 0, 0]
vehicle_loads:[74, 0, 0]
vehicle_remaining_capacity:[26, 100, 100]
To aid your analysis, I extracted the following features from this state:
average_demand:12.2
demand_variance:45.16
average_distance:56.48888888888889
max_distance:98.0
min_distance:3.0
distance_variance:589.9832098765431
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.4066666666666667
node_to_vehicle_ratio:3.3333333333333335

You believe that  InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4) is better with reason  Inserting node 8 after node 4 would more closely resemble the positive solution, potentially leading to a lower overall cost.. So we hope to update farthest_insertion_6308 to output  InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4) in this state.
Try to provide suggestion to update the code using mathematical analysis.

Please provide suggestion in following one or more aspects:
1. Set the hyper-parameters or update the hyper-parameters' value for better control.
2. Add more logic to this function for better control.
3. Limit the application scope of certain logic with an if-check.
4. Consider providing different output operators, such as operation type, operation subject, operation location, operation time, etc.
5. Also consider learning from other heuristics:
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.

To make sure the suggestion is useful, please check in following aspects:
1. Is this suggestion clear and achievable? For example, choosing operation A brings greater benefits in the form of rebates is not a clear and achievable suggestion because we do not know how to measure future benefits.
2. Will the updated suggestion make the function output  InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4) in this step?
3. If we run the updated function on this data from beginning to end, will the result be better than vehicle_0: 0->1->7->6->3->2->4->8->0
vehicle_1: 0->9->5->0
vehicle_2: 0->0 (443.0)?
4. Is this a commonly useful update for all instances or states?

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***suggestion: 
1. Adjust the hyper-parameters to emphasize insertion cost more significantly. Increase `spread_penalty_weight` to 0.5 and `capacity_utilization_weight` to 0.7. This will prioritize solutions that maintain route compactness and efficient vehicle utilization.
2. Implement additional logic to evaluate the position of the node being inserted. Introduce a check to prefer inserting nodes in positions that minimize the resulting distance from the depot, which aligns with the positive solution.
3. Limit the application scope of the greedy improvement and inter-vehicle swapping by adding an if-check to restrict these operations to states where the vehicle load is above a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
4. Learn from `nearest_neighbor_54a9` by incorporating a demand-priority strategy. When evaluating potential insertions, give preference to nodes with higher demands that can still fit within the remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low.

This suggestion should lead the heuristic to output `InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4)` in this state. The enhanced focus on compactness and demand-priority should also improve the overall solution quality, potentially yielding a result better than 443.0. These updates aim to be generally applicable across different instances of the problem, improving the heuristic's adaptability and performance.
