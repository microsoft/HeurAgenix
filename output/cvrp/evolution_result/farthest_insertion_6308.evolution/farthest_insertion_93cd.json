Never modify the data in global, state and algorithm data.\n4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.\n5.

We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.\n7. The name of function must be farthest_insertion_e7db. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.\n8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.\n9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly \"algorithm_data[\"abc\"] = 123\", we should return operator, {\"abc\": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}\n10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.\n11.

What factors contribute to these differences in performance?\n3. Is the updated heuristic farthest_insertion_e7db better than previous heuristic farthest_insertion_6308 and is the previous evolution suggestion 1. Adjust the hyper-parameters to emphasize insertion cost more significantly. Increase `spread_penalty_weight` to 0.5 and `capacity_utilization_weight` to 0.7.

Limit the application scope of the greedy improvement and inter-vehicle swapping by adding an if-check to restrict these operations to states where the vehicle load is above a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).\n4.

When evaluating potential insertions, give preference to nodes with higher demands that can still fit within the remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low.\n\nThis suggestion should lead the heuristic to output `InsertOperator(vehicle_id=0, node=8, position=4)` in this state.

In cases where demand variance is high, the decreased weights may lead to suboptimal decisions.
