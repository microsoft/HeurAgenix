It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP.
