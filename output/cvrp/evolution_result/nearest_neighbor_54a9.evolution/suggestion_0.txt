I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of nodes in the problem.
    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is cvrp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively tackled using heuristic methods. Your framework's design, with the `Solution` and `Operator` classes, aligns well with the requirements for employing heuristic algorithms in solving such problems. The operators you have implemented (Append, Insert, Swap, ReverseSegment, Relocate, and MergeRoutes) are standard operations used in many heuristic approaches for CVRP, and the provided heuristic function signature seems appropriate for facilitating the implementation of various heuristic algorithms.

In this instance, I have developed a heuristic function, although its performance has not reached a satisfactory level. My goal is to learn from case studies to improve and optimize this heuristic. To achieve this, I will provide the following:
1. The heuristic function code.
2. Test data for evaluation.
3. Negative solution from heuristic function.
4. Positive solution from external, which is better than negative solution.

The function nearest_neighbor_54a9 is the heuristic function:

    """ Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP.

    This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - distance_matrix (numpy.ndarray): 2D array representing distances between nodes.
            - demands (numpy.ndarray): Array of demands for each node.
            - capacity (int): Capacity of each vehicle.
            - depot (int): Index of the depot node.
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current routes for all vehicles.
            - unvisited_nodes (list[int]): Nodes not yet visited by any vehicle.
            - last_visited (list[int]): Last visited node for each vehicle.
            - vehicle_remaining_capacity (list[int]): Remaining capacity for each vehicle.
        get_state_data_function (callable): Function to calculate state data for a new solution.
        **kwargs: Hyper-parameters for the heuristic algorithm.
            - high_demand_threshold (int, default=6): Threshold for considering the number of unvisited nodes as low.

    Returns:
        InsertOperator: Operator to insert the chosen node into the current solution.

Please based on the data and solution, help to pick out the bottleneck operations in negative solution, which may cause the poor performance
Please note:
1. Some operations, although they appear different, are essentially the same.
2. Some operations may lead to solutions that look different but are essentially the same.
3. Some operations may cause changes to the solution but do not affect the final cost; these are not considered bottlenecks.
4. When an operation A is performed poorly, leading to a series of subsequent operations experiencing issues, we consider the first operation A to be a bottleneck.
5. If there is only one item, there is no need to force multiple answers.
6. Try to propose a better operator than origin one and you can learn from positive solution or others.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***bottleneck_operations:
10; AppendOperator(vehicle_id=4, node=3); In the negative solution, node 3 was inserted into vehicle 2's route, leading to a longer route. In the positive solution, appending node 3 to vehicle 4's route directly improves the overall cost.
12; AppendOperator(vehicle_id=3, node=1); In the negative solution, node 1 was inserted at the beginning of vehicle 3's route, but appending it to vehicle 3's existing route in the positive solution resulted in a more efficient path.

Now focus on this operator InsertOperator(vehicle_id=2, node=3, position=0) in step 10.

The state before InsertOperator(vehicle_id=2, node=3, position=0) is:
current_solution:
vehicle_0: 0->12->9->10->7->8->0
vehicle_1: 0->4->6->14->0
vehicle_2: 0->2->11->0
vehicle_3: 0->0
vehicle_4: 0->0

visited_nodes:[0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14]
visited_num:11
unvisited_nodes:[1, 3, 5, 13]
unvisited_num:4
total_current_cost:5681.0
last_visited:[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
vehicle_loads:[98, 97, 61, 0, 0]
vehicle_remaining_capacity:[2, 3, 39, 100, 100]
To aid your analysis, I extracted the following features from this state:
average_demand:29.0
demand_variance:325.06666666666666
average_distance:544.0095238095238
max_distance:1171.0
min_distance:128.0
distance_variance:51813.342766439906
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.87
node_to_vehicle_ratio:3.0

You believe that  AppendOperator(vehicle_id=4, node=3) is better with reason  In the negative solution, node 3 was inserted into vehicle 2's route, leading to a longer route. In the positive solution, appending node 3 to vehicle 4's route directly improves the overall cost.. So we hope to update nearest_neighbor_54a9 to output  AppendOperator(vehicle_id=4, node=3) in this state.
Try to provide suggestion to update the code using mathematical analysis.

Please provide suggestion in following one or more aspects:
1. Set the hyper-parameters or update the hyper-parameters' value for better control.
2. Add more logic to this function for better control.
3. Limit the application scope of certain logic with an if-check.
4. Consider providing different output operators, such as operation type, operation subject, operation location, operation time, etc.
5. Also consider learning from other heuristics:
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.

To make sure the suggestion is useful, please check in following aspects:
1. Is this suggestion clear and achievable? For example, choosing operation A brings greater benefits in the form of rebates is not a clear and achievable suggestion because we do not know how to measure future benefits.
2. Will the updated suggestion make the function output  AppendOperator(vehicle_id=4, node=3) in this step?
3. If we run the updated function on this data from beginning to end, will the result be better than vehicle_0: 0->12->9->10->7->8->0
vehicle_1: 0->4->6->14->0
vehicle_2: 0->2->11->0
vehicle_3: 0->5->1->0
vehicle_4: 0->13->3->0 (9929.0)?
4. Is this a commonly useful update for all instances or states?

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***suggestion: 
1. Update hyper-parameters to prioritize capacity utilization: Introduce a new hyper-parameter, `capacity_utilization_threshold`, to prioritize operations that maximize vehicle capacity utilization. Set this to a value like 0.9 to ensure vehicles with a lower load are prioritized for new insertions when capacity utilization is below this threshold.

2. Introduce logic to evaluate insertion versus append: Incorporate a scoring mechanism that evaluates both insertion and append operations based on their impact on route compactness and cost. If an append operation results in a lower overall cost increase and better capacity utilization, prioritize it.

3. Add an if-check for load balancing: Before deciding on an operation, check if appending a node can help balance the load across vehicles, thus reducing the likelihood of future capacity constraints.

4. Consider learning from other heuristics: Incorporate logic from `farthest_insertion_6308` to evaluate the potential impact of a node on future insertions, and from `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` to optimize the order of operations based on cost efficiency.
