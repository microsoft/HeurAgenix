I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""

        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal combination of routes for a fleet of vehicles to satisfy constraints such as vehicle capacities and minimizing total travel cost. Your framework with a `Solution` class, operators, and heuristic function signature appears to align well with solving this type of problem using heuristics. The operators such as `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, etc., are standard mechanisms for exploring the solution space in heuristic or metaheuristic approaches.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
To determine the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is most applicable, we need to analyze their design principles, strengths, and limitations. Below is a detailed analysis of the algorithms you provided, along with the best-suited scenarios for each:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308()`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: This heuristic selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism considering insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It also applies greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for Large-Scale Problems**: The farthest insertion heuristic tends to perform well when the problem involves a large number of nodes because it prioritizes nodes that are farthest from the existing solution, ensuring better exploration of the solution space.
     - **Non-Uniform Node Distribution**: This approach is effective in instances where nodes are not evenly distributed geographically, as it focuses on covering distant nodes early.
     - **Quantification**:
       - Large problem size: `node_num > 500`.
       - Highly scattered demand nodes: `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`.
       - High capacity utilization: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold`.

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b()`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: Optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and employing efficient logic.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for Small- to Medium-Sized Problems**: The focus on minimizing insertion cost makes this heuristic computationally efficient, which is ideal for smaller instances where a quick, feasible solution is required.
     - **Tightly Clustered Nodes**: When nodes are geographically close to one another, minimizing cost through direct insertion becomes effective.
     - **Quantification**:
       - Medium problem size: `100 < node_num <= 500`.
       - Clustered nodes: `average_distance_between_nodes < threshold`.
       - Balanced capacity utilization: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity ≈ threshold`.

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9()`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: Prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity and applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for Problems with High-Demand Nodes**: This heuristic is effective when certain nodes have much higher demands compared to others, as it prioritizes these nodes for early inclusion.
     - **Compact Route Optimization**: The periodic 2-opt heuristic makes it suitable for instances where route compactness is critical.
     - **Quantification**:
       - Low remaining capacity: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold`.
       - Few unvisited nodes: `unvisited_node_count < threshold`.
       - High-demand nodes: `max_node_demand > average_node_demand`.

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0)`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: Merges routes based on savings, considering vehicle capacity constraints.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for Initial Solution Construction**: The saving algorithm is typically used to construct an initial feasible solution quickly, which can later be refined by other heuristics.
     - **Sparse Networks with Low Vehicle Capacity Utilization**: Works well when there are opportunities to combine routes due to low vehicle utilization.
     - **Quantification**:
       - Sparse node distribution: `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`.
       - High savings potential: `average_savings_value > threshold`.
       - Low vehicle utilization: `average_vehicle_load / vehicle_capacity < threshold`.

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7()`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: Implements a 3-opt heuristic to improve solutions by considering three edges and exploring potential replacements.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for High-Quality Refinement**: The 3-opt heuristic is computationally expensive but provides significant improvements in solution quality, making it suitable for fine-tuning a near-optimal solution.
     - **Complex Problems Requiring High Compactness**: Effective in instances where route compactness and cost minimization are critical.
     - **Quantification**:
       - High-quality refinement needed: `total_current_cost - best_known_cost > threshold`.
       - High computational resources available: `runtime_budget > threshold`.
       - High node density: `average_distance_between_nodes < threshold`.

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554()`**
   - **Introduction Analysis**: Implements a 2-opt heuristic to improve solutions by reversing segments of a route to reduce travel cost.
   - **Scenarios**:
     - **Best for Moderate Refinement**: The 2-opt heuristic is less computationally expensive than 3-opt, making it suitable for iterative improvement of solutions without excessive computational overhead.
     - **Compact Networks with Moderate Node Count**: Performs well in cases where routes are relatively short and improvements can be achieved through simple segment reversals.
     - **Quantification**:
       - Moderate-quality refinement needed: `total_current_cost - best_known_cost ≈ threshold`.
       - Moderate computational resources available: `runtime_budget ≈ threshold`.
       - Moderate node density: `average_distance_between_nodes ≈ threshold`.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The initial state indicates that no nodes have been visited, and all vehicles are at the depot with full capacity. Given the large number of unvisited nodes (100) and the relatively high vehicle capacity utilization (0.91125), the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is well-suited to begin constructing a solution. This heuristic prioritizes distant nodes, ensuring a more even exploration of the solution space in the early stages while considering capacity constraints. Running 10 steps will allow us to form a partial solution and assess progress.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 79.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 158
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: 1300). Additionally, the periodic 2-opt compactness improvements in this heuristic can help optimize the routes formed so far. Running 15 steps allows for significant progress while balancing computational effort.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 51.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 239

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
running steps: 10
explanation: Given the current state, the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic remains suitable for further improvement. The remaining unvisited nodes (75) have an average demand of 14.15, which aligns with the capability of this heuristic to prioritize higher-demand nodes that can fit into the remaining vehicle capacities. The periodic 2-opt improvements can also help optimize existing routes, particularly since the standard deviation of route lengths (9.09) indicates room for compactness optimization. Running 10 more steps strikes a balance between continuing the progress made and assessing diminishing returns from this heuristic before switching.
