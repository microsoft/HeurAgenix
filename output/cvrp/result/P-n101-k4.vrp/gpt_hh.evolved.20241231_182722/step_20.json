Below is a detailed analysis of the algorithms you provided, along with the best-suited scenarios for each:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308()`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: This heuristic selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism considering insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It also applies greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for Large-Scale Problems**: The farthest insertion heuristic tends to perform well when the problem involves a large number of nodes because it prioritizes nodes that are farthest from the existing solution, ensuring better exploration of the solution space.\n     - **Non-Uniform Node Distribution**: This approach is effective in instances where nodes are not evenly distributed geographically, as it focuses on covering distant nodes early.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - Large problem size: `node_num > 500`.\n       - Highly scattered demand nodes: `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`.\n       - High capacity utilization: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b()`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: Optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and employing efficient logic.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for Small- to Medium-Sized Problems**: The focus on minimizing insertion cost makes this heuristic computationally efficient, which is ideal for smaller instances where a quick, feasible solution is required.\n     - **Tightly Clustered Nodes**: When nodes are geographically close to one another, minimizing cost through direct insertion becomes effective.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - Medium problem size: `100 < node_num <= 500`.\n       - Clustered nodes: `average_distance_between_nodes < threshold`.\n       - Balanced capacity utilization: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity \u2248 threshold`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9()`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: Prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity and applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for Problems with High-Demand Nodes**: This heuristic is effective when certain nodes have much higher demands compared to others, as it prioritizes these nodes for early inclusion.\n     - **Compact Route Optimization**: The periodic 2-opt heuristic makes it suitable for instances where route compactness is critical.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - Low remaining capacity: `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold`.\n       - Few unvisited nodes: `unvisited_node_count < threshold`.\n       - High-demand nodes: `max_node_demand > average_node_demand`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0)`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: Merges routes based on savings, considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for Initial Solution Construction**: The saving algorithm is typically used to construct an initial feasible solution quickly, which can later be refined by other heuristics.\n     - **Sparse Networks with Low Vehicle Capacity Utilization**: Works well when there are opportunities to combine routes due to low vehicle utilization.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - Sparse node distribution: `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`.\n       - High savings potential: `average_savings_value > threshold`.\n       - Low vehicle utilization: `average_vehicle_load / vehicle_capacity < threshold`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7()`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: Implements a 3-opt heuristic to improve solutions by considering three edges and exploring potential replacements.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for High-Quality Refinement**: The 3-opt heuristic is computationally expensive but provides significant improvements in solution quality, making it suitable for fine-tuning a near-optimal solution.\n     - **Complex Problems Requiring High Compactness**: Effective in instances where route compactness and cost minimization are critical.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - High-quality refinement needed: `total_current_cost - best_known_cost > threshold`.\n       - High computational resources available: `runtime_budget > threshold`.\n       - High node density: `average_distance_between_nodes < threshold`.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554()`**\n   - **Introduction Analysis**: Implements a 2-opt heuristic to improve solutions by reversing segments of a route to reduce travel cost.\n   - **Scenarios**:\n     - **Best for Moderate Refinement**: The 2-opt heuristic is less computationally expensive than 3-opt, making it suitable for iterative improvement of solutions without excessive computational overhead.\n     - **Compact Networks with Moderate Node Count**: Performs well in cases where routes are relatively short and improvements can be achieved through simple segment reversals.\n     - **Quantification**:\n       - Moderate-quality refinement needed: `total_current_cost - best_known_cost \u2248 threshold`.\n       - Moderate computational resources available: `runtime_budget \u2248 threshold`.\n       - Moderate node density: `average_distance_between_nodes \u2248 threshold`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Applicability:\n| **Heuristic**             | **Best Scenario**                               | **Quantification**                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308()` | Large-scale problems, non-uniform nodes         | `node_num > 500`, `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`, `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold` |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()`| Small-medium problems, clustered nodes          | `100 < node_num <= 500`, `average_distance_between_nodes < threshold`, `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity \u2248 threshold` |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9()`  | High-demand nodes, compact routes               | `unvisited_node_count < threshold`, `max_node_demand > average_node_demand`, `average_vehicle_remaining_capacity < threshold` |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e()`  | Initial solutions, sparse networks              | `average_distance_between_nodes > threshold`, `average_savings_value > threshold`, `average_vehicle_load / vehicle_capacity < threshold` |\n| `three_opt_e8d7()`         | High-quality refinement, compactness critical   | `total_current_cost -

Given the large number of unvisited nodes (100) and the relatively high vehicle capacity utilization (0.91125), the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is well-suited to begin constructing a solution. This heuristic prioritizes distant nodes, ensuring a more even exploration of the solution space in the early stages while considering capacity constraints. Running 10 steps will allow us to form a partial solution and assess progress.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 79.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 158\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: 1300). Additionally, the periodic 2-opt compactness improvements in this heuristic can help optimize the routes formed so far. Running 15 steps allows for significant progress while balancing computational effort.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 51.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 239\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic remains suitable for further improvement. The remaining unvisited nodes (75) have an average demand of 14.15, which aligns with the capability of this heuristic to prioritize higher-demand nodes that can fit into the remaining vehicle capacities. The periodic 2-opt improvements can also help optimize existing routes, particularly since the standard deviation of route lengths (9.09) indicates room for compactness optimization.

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
