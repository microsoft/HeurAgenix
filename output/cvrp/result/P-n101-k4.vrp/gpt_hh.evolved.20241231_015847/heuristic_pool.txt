I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal solution from a finite but large set of possible solutions, aligning with the characteristics of combinatorial operation problems. The framework you described, including the `Solution`, `Operator`, and heuristic function signature, is valid and well-structured for solving such problems using heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

The heuristics you have implemented are well-suited for solving the CVRP under different scenarios. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable and how these scenarios can be quantified:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Suitable for problems where node distribution is sparse or highly uneven, and distant nodes may be overlooked by other heuristics.
   - Prioritizes route compactness and capacity utilization, making it ideal when managing large capacities or widely distributed demands.
   - Effective for instances where a balance between exploration (adding distant nodes) and exploitation (greedy improvements) is needed.

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Node Distribution**: High variance in node distances (quantified using the standard deviation of distances in the distance matrix).  
   - **Demand Distribution**: Uniform or low variance in demand values.  
   - **Vehicle Capacity**: Large capacity relative to average node demand (e.g., capacity > 5× average demand).

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Best for problems where minimizing insertion cost is critical, such as when optimizing for fuel costs or travel time.  
   - Works well in scenarios with dense node distributions and when computational efficiency is important for large-scale problems.

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Node Density**: High density of nodes (quantified by average node distance being low).  
   - **Instance Size**: Large number of nodes (> 100).  
   - **Cost Sensitivity**: Low variance in demand values but high variance in distances, emphasizing cost optimization.

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Ideal for small- to medium-sized problem instances with moderate node density.  
   - Performs well when demands are not uniform, and some nodes have significantly higher demands than others.  
   - Suitable for problems where a quick and simple solution is needed, and solution quality can later be improved with local optimization (e.g., 2-opt).

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Node Density**: Moderate density of nodes (average node distance is neither too high nor too low).  
   - **Demand Distribution**: High variance in demand values (e.g., some nodes have demand > 2× average demand).  
   - **Instance Size**: Small to medium instance size (10–100 nodes).

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Suitable for problems where initial routes are already defined (e.g., one node per route) and need to be merged efficiently.  
   - Works well when merging routes can lead to significant savings in total travel cost.  
   - The `merge_threshold` parameter allows fine-tuning for scenarios with strict capacity constraints or specific savings requirements.

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Initial Routes**: High number of initial routes relative to vehicles (e.g., more than twice the number of vehicles).  
   - **Savings Potential**: High variance in pairwise distances (e.g., some pairs have distance savings > average savings).  
   - **Capacity Utilization**: Low to medium capacity usage per vehicle.

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Effective for refining existing solutions to achieve high-quality results by reducing total travel cost.  
   - Works best on medium to large problem instances where routes are already compact but can be further optimized.  
   - Suitable for problems with no time constraints for computation, as 3-opt is computationally expensive.

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Instance Size**: Medium to large instances (50–500 nodes).  
   - **Existing Solution Quality**: Moderate-quality initial solutions (e.g., total cost > 1.2× optimal cost).  
   - **Computation Time**: When longer computation times are acceptable.

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Suitable for quick local optimization of routes to improve route compactness.  
   - Best for small to medium-sized problem instances or as a post-processing step for other heuristics.  
   - Effective for problems with routes that have significant overlap or crossing paths.

   **Quantification**:  
   - **Instance Size**: Small to medium instances (10–200 nodes).  
   - **Existing Solution Quality**: Poorly optimized initial solutions (e.g., total cost > 1.5× optimal cost).  
   - **Route Compactness**: High number of overlapping or crossing paths (quantified using the number of intersecting edges in the routes).

### Summary of Applicability and Quantifiers:

| Algorithm                | Node Density       | Demand Distribution | Instance Size          | Cost Sensitivity | Optimization Type       | Time Sensitivity |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| `farthest_insertion_6308` | Sparse/Uneven      | Uniform/Low Variance| Medium to Large (> 50) | Medium           | Exploratory + Refinement| Moderate         |
| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`| Dense              | Uniform/Low Variance| Large (> 100)          | High             | Cost Minimization       | High             |
| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`  | Moderate           | High Variance       | Small to Medium (10–100)| Low              | Simple + Local Refinement| Low              |
| `saving_algorithm_710e`  | Any                | Any                 | Medium to Large (> 50) | Medium           | Route Merging           | Low to Moderate  |
| `three_opt_e8d7`         | Any                | Any                 | Medium to Large (50–500)| Medium           | High-Quality Refinement| Low              |
| `two_opt_0554`           | Any                | Any                 | Small to Medium (10–200)| Low              | Quick Local Optimization| High             |

---

### Recommendations:
- Use the quantifiers (node density, demand distribution, instance size, etc.) as metrics to select the appropriate heuristic for your problem instance.
- For real-world applications, a combination of these heuristics can be used. For example:
  - Start with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `saving_algorithm_710e` to quickly generate an initial feasible solution.
  - Apply `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` for refining the solution.
  - Use `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` or `farthest_insertion_6308` for specific scenarios requiring cost minimization or exploration of distant nodes.
