                "text": "The heuristics you have implemented are well-suited for solving the CVRP under different scenarios. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable and how these scenarios can be quantified:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for problems where node distribution is sparse or highly uneven, and distant nodes may be overlooked by other heuristics.\n   - Prioritizes route compactness and capacity utilization, making it ideal when managing large capacities or widely distributed demands.\n   - Effective for instances where a balance between exploration (adding distant nodes) and exploitation (greedy improvements) is needed.\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: High variance in node distances (quantified using the standard deviation of distances in the distance matrix).  \n   - **Demand Distribution**: Uniform or low variance in demand values.  \n   - **Vehicle Capacity**: Large capacity relative to average node demand (e.g., capacity > 5\u00d7 average demand).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for problems where minimizing insertion cost is critical, such as when optimizing for fuel costs or travel time.  \n   - Works well in scenarios with dense node distributions and when computational efficiency is important for large-scale problems.\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Node Density**: High density of nodes (quantified by average node distance being low).  \n   - **Instance Size**: Large number of nodes (> 100).  \n   - **Cost Sensitivity**: Low variance in demand values but high variance in distances, emphasizing cost optimization.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Ideal for small- to medium-sized problem instances with moderate node density.  \n   - Performs well when demands are not uniform, and some nodes have significantly higher demands than others.  \n   - Suitable for problems where a quick and simple solution is needed, and solution quality can later be improved with local optimization (e.g., 2-opt).\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Node Density**: Moderate density of nodes (average node distance is neither too high nor too low).  \n   - **Demand Distribution**: High variance in demand values (e.g., some nodes have demand > 2\u00d7 average demand).  \n   - **Instance Size**: Small to medium instance size (10\u2013100 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for problems where initial routes are already defined (e.g., one node per route) and need to be merged efficiently.  \n   - Works well when merging routes can lead to significant savings in total travel cost.  \n   - The `merge_threshold` parameter allows fine-tuning for scenarios with strict capacity constraints or specific savings requirements.\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Initial Routes**: High number of initial routes relative to vehicles (e.g., more than twice the number of vehicles).  \n   - **Savings Potential**: High variance in pairwise distances (e.g., some pairs have distance savings > average savings).  \n   - **Capacity Utilization**: Low to medium capacity usage per vehicle.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Effective for refining existing solutions to achieve high-quality results by reducing total travel cost.  \n   - Works best on medium to large problem instances where routes are already compact but can be further optimized.  \n   - Suitable for problems with no time constraints for computation, as 3-opt is computationally expensive.\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Instance Size**: Medium to large instances (50\u2013500 nodes).  \n   - **Existing Solution Quality**: Moderate-quality initial solutions (e.g., total cost > 1.2\u00d7 optimal cost).  \n   - **Computation Time**: When longer computation times are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for quick local optimization of routes to improve route compactness.  \n   - Best for small to medium-sized problem instances or as a post-processing step for other heuristics.  \n   - Effective for problems with routes that have significant overlap or crossing paths.\n\n   **Quantification**:  \n   - **Instance Size**: Small to medium instances (10\u2013200 nodes).  \n   - **Existing Solution Quality**: Poorly optimized initial solutions (e.g., total cost > 1.5\u00d7 optimal cost).  \n   - **Route Compactness**: High number of overlapping or crossing paths (quantified using the number of intersecting edges in the routes).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Applicability and Quantifiers:\n\n| Algorithm                | Node Density       | Demand Distribution | Instance Size          | Cost Sensitivity | Optimization Type       | Time Sensitivity |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308` | Sparse/Uneven      | Uniform/Low Variance| Medium to Large (> 50) | Medium           | Exploratory + Refinement| Moderate         |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`| Dense              | Uniform/Low Variance| Large (> 100)          | High             | Cost Minimization       | High             |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`  | Moderate           | High Variance       | Small to Medium (10\u2013100)| Low              | Simple + Local Refinement| Low              |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e`  | Any                | Any                 | Medium to Large (> 50) | Medium           | Route Merging           | Low to Moderate  |\n| `three_opt_e8d7`         | Any                | Any                 | Medium to Large (50\u2013500)| Medium           | High-Quality Refinement| Low              |\n| `two_opt_0554`           | Any                | Any                 | Small to Medium (10\u2013200)| Low              | Quick Local Optimization| High             |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Use the quantifiers (node density, demand distribution, instance size, etc.) as metrics to select the appropriate heuristic for your problem instance.\n- For real-world applications, a combination of these heuristics can be used. For example:\n  - Start with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `saving_algorithm_710e` to quickly generate an initial feasible solution.\n  - Apply `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` for refining the solution.\n  - Use `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` or `farthest_insertion_6308` for specific scenarios requiring cost minimization or exploration of distant nodes.\n\n"

Given the high number of unvisited nodes (100) and the moderate variance in demand, the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable for quickly constructing an initial feasible solution. This heuristic effectively handles the high number of unvisited nodes by prioritizing demands that fit within vehicle capacities. Running for 10 steps will allow us to evaluate the initial solution quality and determine if further refinement or switching to another heuristic is needed.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 52.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 179\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is still in the construction phase, with 90 nodes unvisited and only one vehicle partially utilized. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed effectively in the initial round by adding 10 nodes and fulfilling 179 demands while maintaining solution validity. Its prioritization of high-demand nodes within vehicle capacity constraints makes it suitable to continue building the solution further. Running it for another 10 steps allows for incremental progress while monitoring its performance before considering a switch to a refinement heuristic like `2_opt_0554`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 34.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 127\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The problem is still in the construction phase, with 80 nodes remaining unvisited and only one vehicle utilized. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has demonstrated effective performance in the prior two rounds, consistently adding 10 nodes and fulfilling significant demand while maintaining solution validity. Its prioritization of high-demand nodes and capacity constraints remains suitable for this stage. Running for another 10 steps will allow further incremental progress while monitoring its performance before considering a switch to refinement heuristics like `2_opt_0554`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 79.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 155\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is still in the construction phase with 70 nodes remaining unvisited and only two vehicles partially utilized.

Given its prioritization of high-demand nodes and efficient handling of capacity constraints, it remains a suitable choice at this stage. Running for another 10 steps will allow further progress in constructing the solution while monitoring for diminishing returns before considering a switch to refinement heuristics like `2_opt_0554`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 54.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 154\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is still in the construction phase with 60 nodes remaining unvisited and only two vehicles utilized. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated effective performance in the prior rounds, adding 10 nodes per round and fulfilling significant demand. The current state data indicates that the heuristic remains suitable due to its prioritization of high-demand nodes and efficient handling of capacity constraints. Running for another 10 steps will further progress the construction while monitoring for diminishing returns.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 87.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 125\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a more advanced construction phase with 51 nodes visited and 50 nodes remaining unvisited. Two vehicles are utilized, and the remaining vehicle capacities are sufficient to accommodate the unvisited nodes. However, the current solution has an average route length of 12.5, with a high standard deviation of 12.52, indicating uneven route compactness. Additionally, the total current cost has increased significantly in the last round, suggesting diminishing returns from `nearest_neighbor_54a9`. A 2-opt heuristic is suitable for improving route compactness and reducing overlapping paths in this scenario. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness before considering a switch to `three_opt_e8d7` for further refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -10.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic has been applied, and while it successfully reduced the total cost by 10.0, it did not contribute to improving node visitation or fulfilling additional demand. The high standard deviation of route lengths (12.52) still indicates uneven route compactness, and further refinement is necessary to optimize the solution. Given that `three_opt_e8d7` is more powerful than `two_opt_0554` for improving route efficiency, it is appropriate to try it for 10 steps to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing overlapping paths and improving route compactness.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -3.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The previous application of the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic resulted in a small reduction in cost (-3.0) but did not significantly improve route compactness, as the standard deviation of route lengths (12.52) remains high. This indicates that `three_opt_e8d7` is effective but may need more steps to fully refine the solution. Given the advanced state of the solution, where 51 nodes have been visited and the focus is on optimizing route efficiency rather than constructing new routes, increasing the number of steps to 20 will provide more opportunity for `three_opt_e8d7` to make substantial improvements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 30\nExplain: The previous applications of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown minor improvements in cost reduction but no significant impact on route compactness, as indicated by the high standard deviation of route lengths (12.52). Given the advanced stage of the solution, where the focus is on refining route efficiency rather than constructing new routes, increasing the number of steps to 30 will provide `three_opt_e8d7` with more opportunities to make substantial improvements. This is especially important since `two_opt_0554` has shown limited success earlier, and `three_opt_e8d7` is a more powerful heuristic for advanced refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 50\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has shown potential for advanced solution refinement, but its performance has been limited in prior rounds due to insufficient steps, as evident from the lack of substantial cost reductions or improvements in route compactness. The high standard deviation of route lengths (12.52) and the imbalance in route utilization (two vehicles still idle) suggest that significant optimization opportunities remain. Increasing the running steps to 50 will provide `three_opt_e8d7` with more room to explore and refine the solution. This is critical to address the uneven route compactness and reduce overlapping paths further.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 50\nExplain: The previous rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown limited improvement, primarily due to insufficient steps. The high standard deviation of route lengths (12.52), uneven route utilization (two vehicles still idle), and no reduction in cost in recent rounds indicate that further optimization opportunities remain. Given the advanced stage of the solution, with all focus on refinement, continuing with `three_opt_e8d7` for another 50 steps is justified. This will allow more time for the heuristic to explore and address route compactness and overlapping paths, which are critical at this stage.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 50\nExplain: The current solution is at an advanced stage with 51 visited nodes, leaving 50 unvisited. Despite previous rounds of `three_opt_e8d7`, the lack of significant progress in cost reduction and route compactness (standard deviation of route lengths still at 12.52) suggests that further optimization opportunities remain. The imbalance in route utilization (two vehicles idle) also indicates potential for improvement. Since `two_opt_0554` has shown limited effectiveness earlier, `three_opt_e8d7` remains the most suitable choice for addressing these issues. Running it for another 50 steps provides sufficient room for exploration and refinement to improve route compactness and overall solution quality.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: The solution is in an advanced refinement phase with 51 visited nodes, leaving 50 unvisited. Previous rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown limited progress, primarily due to an insufficient number of steps. The high standard deviation of route lengths (12.52) and the imbalance in route utilization (two vehicles idle) indicate that optimization opportunities remain, particularly for improving route compactness and reducing overlapping paths. As `three_opt_e8d7` is more powerful than `two_opt_0554` for advanced refinements, increasing the number of steps to 100 will provide the heuristic with more room to explore and address these issues comprehensively. This is critical at this stage to unlock further improvements in solution quality.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1.
