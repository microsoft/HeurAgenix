I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id] = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]
        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

Got it! You've constructed a comprehensive framework for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using hyper-heuristics. Here’s a summary of the framework components:

### Solution Class
A `Solution` class that represents the routes for vehicles:
```python
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP. A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
```

```python
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
```

#### InsertOperator

    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
```

#### SwapOperator
Swaps two nodes between or within vehicle routes.
```python
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        # Ensure vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2 for consistency
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
```

#### ReverseSegmentOperator
Reverses multiple segments of indices in the solution.
```python
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index > end_index:
                (start_index, end_index) = (end_index, start_index)
            new_routes[self.vehicle_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_routes[self.vehicle_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
```

#### RelocateOperator

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Each heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) has scenarios where it performs optimally based on the problem's characteristics and constraints. Here’s an analysis of each algorithm and the scenarios where they are most applicable:

### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**
- **Scenario**: When the current solution is relatively close to optimal, but there is still room for improvement by eliminating crossing routes.
- **Quantification**: Applicable when the initial solution has many intersecting routes or when a local optimization is needed after a more global heuristic has been applied.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**
- **Scenario**: When the solution landscape is rugged with many local optima, and systematic changes in neighborhood structure can help escape local optima.
- **Quantification**: Useful for large instances where simple heuristics get stuck in local optima. The performance can be quantified by the diversity of neighborhood structures and the improvement rate over iterations.

### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d`)**
- **Scenario**: Similar to Two-Opt but more aggressive in route optimization, especially effective for moderately complex solutions needing substantial route refinement.
- **Quantification**: Best when the solution has suboptimal segments that can be significantly improved by removing three edges and reconnecting the routes optimally.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**
- **Scenario**: When a quick and straightforward initial solution is needed, especially effective in sparse graphs where nodes are scattered.
- **Quantification**: Applicable for initial solution generation with quantifiable performance in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality for graphs with high node dispersion.

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)**
- **Scenario**: When constructing an initial solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node is preferred.
- **Quantification**: Best for problems where nodes are densely packed, and the nearest neighbor approach may still yield a reasonably good solution. The performance can be measured by initial solution quality and construction speed.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**
- **Scenario**: When merging routes based on cost savings can lead to significant improvements, especially in homogeneous demand scenarios.
- **Quantification**: Effective when initial routes can be combined without violating constraints. Performance is quantified by savings metrics and the merge threshold.

### 7. **Random Heuristic (`random_bfdc`)**
- **Scenario**: When a diverse set of initial solutions is needed for further optimization or when randomness can help explore the solution space.
- **Quantification**: Best for generating diverse initial solutions. The effectiveness is measured by the variety and quality of solutions produced and their potential for further optimization.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**
- **Scenario**: When forming feasible routes around a central depot is advantageous, particularly in scenarios where routes form natural clusters.
- **Quantification**: Suitable for problems with a central depot and geographically clustered nodes. Performance can be measured by the compactness and feasibility of the initial routes.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**
- **Scenario**: When nodes farthest from the depot need to be prioritized to ensure they are included in the solution early.
- **Quantification**: Best for instances with nodes widely spread from the depot. The performance can be quantified by the initial route length and the balance of node distribution.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**
- **Scenario**: When balancing load between routes or reducing total distance by shifting nodes is necessary.
- **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with imbalanced loads or high total distance. The performance is measured by improvements in load balance and route efficiency.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**
- **Scenario**: When a solution needs to be constructed by inserting nodes at the minimum additional cost to the route.
- **Quantification**: Best for constructing cost-efficient routes from scratch. The effectiveness is measured by the total cost and efficiency of the initial solution.

### Summary
- **Initial Solution Generation**: Nearest Neighbor, Greedy, Random, Petal, Farthest Insertion, Min-Cost Insertion
- **Local Optimization**: Two-Opt, Three-Opt, Node Shift Between Routes
- **Diversification and Escape from Local Optima**: Variable Neighborhood Search
- **Route Merging and Savings**: Saving Algorithm

Each heuristic has its strengths and is suited for specific scenarios based on the problem structure and requirements. Understanding these scenarios and quantifying their applicability helps in selecting the right heuristic for a given instance of the CVRP.

Before this discuss, we have already 1 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic will allow us to quickly generate an initial solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node to each vehicle's route, respecting capacity constraints. Running it for 10 steps should give us a good starting point to evaluate the initial routes and make further decisions.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 72.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 135

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_99ba. How does nearest_neighbor_99ba perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

### Analysis of the Current State and Heuristic Selection

#### Current State Summary:
- **Visited Nodes**: 11
- **Unvisited Nodes**: 90
- **Fulfilled Demands**: 135
- **Remaining Demands**: 1323
- **Total Current Cost**: 72.0
- **Vehicle Information**:
    - Vehicle 0: Route: [53, 58, 40, 21, 73, 72, 74, 22, 41, 75], Current Cost: 72.0, Last Visited: 75, Load: 135, Remaining Capacity: 265
    - Vehicle 1, 2, 3: No routes assigned yet

#### Decision-Making Considerations:
1. **Current Data Sufficiency**: The data appears sufficient for making the next decision. We have an initial solution generated by the nearest neighbor heuristic, which has given us a base to build upon.
2. **Need for Further Construction or Refinement**: Given that only one vehicle has a route and a significant number of nodes are yet to be visited, further construction and refinement are necessary.
3. **Performance of Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: The nearest neighbor heuristic has provided a reasonable starting point, but it might not be sufficient alone to achieve an optimal solution.
4. **Next Heuristic Choice**: To continue building upon the current solution, a heuristic that either improves the existing routes or constructs new routes for the remaining vehicles would be beneficial.

### Recommended Next Heuristic

Given the current state and the need to balance between building new routes and refining existing ones, the **Greedy Heuristic** (`greedy_f4c4`) seems appropriate. This heuristic will help in constructing routes for the remaining vehicles by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node, respecting capacity constraints.

### Decision

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_f4c4
running steps: 10
hyper parameter(optional): None
explanation: The Greedy Heuristic will help in constructing routes for the remaining vehicles by adding the closest unvisited nodes, which should help in distributing the load and fulfilling more demands efficiently. Running it for 10 steps should provide a substantial improvement to the current solution.
***

Please proceed with this heuristic and provide the updated solution state once the steps are executed.
