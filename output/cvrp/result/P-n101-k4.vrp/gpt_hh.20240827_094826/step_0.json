                "text": "Certainly! Each heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) has scenarios where it performs optimally based on the problem's characteristics and constraints. Here\u2019s an analysis of each algorithm and the scenarios where they are most applicable:\n\n### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**\n- **Scenario**: When the current solution is relatively close to optimal, but there is still room for improvement by eliminating crossing routes.\n- **Quantification**: Applicable when the initial solution has many intersecting routes or when a local optimization is needed after a more global heuristic has been applied.\n\n### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**\n- **Scenario**: When the solution landscape is rugged with many local optima, and systematic changes in neighborhood structure can help escape local optima.\n- **Quantification**: Useful for large instances where simple heuristics get stuck in local optima. The performance can be quantified by the diversity of neighborhood structures and the improvement rate over iterations.\n\n### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d`)**\n- **Scenario**: Similar to Two-Opt but more aggressive in route optimization, especially effective for moderately complex solutions needing substantial route refinement.\n- **Quantification**: Best when the solution has suboptimal segments that can be significantly improved by removing three edges and reconnecting the routes optimally.\n\n### 4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**\n- **Scenario**: When a quick and straightforward initial solution is needed, especially effective in sparse graphs where nodes are scattered.\n- **Quantification**: Applicable for initial solution generation with quantifiable performance in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality for graphs with high node dispersion.\n\n### 5. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)**\n- **Scenario**: When constructing an initial solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node is preferred.\n- **Quantification**: Best for problems where nodes are densely packed, and the nearest neighbor approach may still yield a reasonably good solution. The performance can be measured by initial solution quality and construction speed.\n\n### 6. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**\n- **Scenario**: When merging routes based on cost savings can lead to significant improvements, especially in homogeneous demand scenarios.\n- **Quantification**: Effective when initial routes can be combined without violating constraints. Performance is quantified by savings metrics and the merge threshold.\n\n### 7. **Random Heuristic (`random_bfdc`)**\n- **Scenario**: When a diverse set of initial solutions is needed for further optimization or when randomness can help explore the solution space.\n- **Quantification**: Best for generating diverse initial solutions. The effectiveness is measured by the variety and quality of solutions produced and their potential for further optimization.\n\n### 8. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**\n- **Scenario**: When forming feasible routes around a central depot is advantageous, particularly in scenarios where routes form natural clusters.\n- **Quantification**: Suitable for problems with a central depot and geographically clustered nodes. Performance can be measured by the compactness and feasibility of the initial routes.\n\n### 9. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**\n- **Scenario**: When nodes farthest from the depot need to be prioritized to ensure they are included in the solution early.\n- **Quantification**: Best for instances with nodes widely spread from the depot. The performance can be quantified by the initial route length and the balance of node distribution.\n\n### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**\n- **Scenario**: When balancing load between routes or reducing total distance by shifting nodes is necessary.\n- **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios with imbalanced loads or high total distance. The performance is measured by improvements in load balance and route efficiency.\n\n### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**\n- **Scenario**: When a solution needs to be constructed by inserting nodes at the minimum additional cost to the route.\n- **Quantification**: Best for constructing cost-efficient routes from scratch. The effectiveness is measured by the total cost and efficiency of the initial solution.\n\n### Summary\n- **Initial Solution Generation**: Nearest Neighbor, Greedy, Random, Petal, Farthest Insertion, Min-Cost Insertion\n- **Local Optimization**: Two-Opt, Three-Opt, Node Shift Between Routes\n- **Diversification and Escape from Local Optima**: Variable Neighborhood Search\n- **Route Merging and Savings**: Saving Algorithm\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is suited for specific scenarios based on the problem structure and requirements. Understanding these scenarios and quantifying their applicability helps in selecting the right heuristic for a given instance of the CVRP."

How does None perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

                "text": "Given the initial state of the problem and the characteristics of the global data, we need to strategically select a heuristic that will effectively start constructing a feasible solution. The demands are quite varied, and with 100 unvisited nodes and 4 vehicles with a capacity of 400 each, we need a heuristic that can handle initial solution construction efficiently.\n\n### Initial Considerations:\n1. **Nearest Neighbor**: This heuristic is quick and effective for generating an initial solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node. However, it may not always yield the most optimal routes.\n2. **Greedy Heuristic**: Similar to Nearest Neighbor but focuses on the closest unvisited node, which can be effective for densely packed nodes.\n3. **Petal Algorithm**: Constructs routes around the depot, which can be useful in scenarios where nodes form natural clusters.\n4. **Min-Cost Insertion**: Constructs routes by inserting nodes at the minimum additional cost, which can lead to more cost-effective routes initially.\n\nGiven the high number of unvisited nodes and the need to construct a feasible initial solution, I recommend starting with a heuristic that can quickly generate an initial set of routes. The **Nearest Neighbor** heuristic is a good candidate for this stage as it will help to quickly lay down a foundation for further optimization.\n\n### Decision:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nrunning steps: 10\nhype parameter(optional): None\nexplanation: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic will allow us to quickly generate an initial solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node to each vehicle's route, respecting capacity constraints. Running it for 10 steps should give us a good starting point to evaluate the initial routes and make further decisions.\n***"
