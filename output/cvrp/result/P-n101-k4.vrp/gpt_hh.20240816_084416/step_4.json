The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity.

This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP.

We will run it for 5 steps and review the performance.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 54.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 79\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Continuing with the greedy heuristic for 5 more steps will allow us to quickly add more nodes to the routes, building a more complete initial solution. After these steps, we can evaluate the progress and consider switching to other heuristics for further optimization.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 59.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 61\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The nearest neighbor heuristic will help in constructing routes for the remaining vehicles by finding the nearest unvisited nodes, thus diversifying the solution and making better use of vehicle capacities.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 48.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 50\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic will attempt to move nodes between routes, aiming to balance the load and improve overall route efficiency. Given that only one vehicle has a route and the others are empty, this heuristic can help distribute the nodes more evenly across the vehicles, potentially reducing the total cost and improving the solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a. How does node_shift_between_routes_7b8a perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

This heuristic focuses on inserting the farthest unvisited node, which can help in extending the routes effectively and making use of the vehicle capacity.\n\n### Recommendation:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b\nrunning steps: 10\nhyper parameter: None\nexplanation: The farthest insertion heuristic will help in efficiently extending the routes by focusing on the farthest unvisited nodes, which can be particularly useful given the large number of unvisited nodes. By running it for 10 steps, we aim to make significant progress in route construction and load distribution.\n***\n\nFeel free to proceed with this recommendation, and let's review the performance after 10 steps."
