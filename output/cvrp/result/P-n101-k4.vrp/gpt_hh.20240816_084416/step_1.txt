I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id

        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The greedy heuristic is well-suited for constructing an initial solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to each vehicle's route. Given that all vehicles are currently empty and the number of unvisited nodes is high, this heuristic will help quickly build feasible routes while considering capacity constraints. We will run it for 5 steps and review the performance.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 5
Delta of Current Cost: 54.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 79

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_f4c4. How does greedy_f4c4 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the provided data and the progress summary, it appears that the greedy heuristic (**greedy_f4c4**) has successfully initiated the solution construction by visiting 5 nodes and fulfilling a significant portion of the demands. Given that a substantial number of nodes remain unvisited and the current solution is still in its early stages, we should consider how best to proceed.

### Considerations for Next Steps:
- **Current State**: Only one vehicle has been used so far, with a moderate increase in the total cost and fulfilled demands.
- **Remaining Nodes**: 95 unvisited nodes remain, which indicates substantial work left for constructing a complete solution.
- **Vehicle Load**: Only 79 units of demand have been fulfilled out of 1458 total demand, indicating that the current approach has room for further optimization.

### Decision Options:

1. **Continue with greedy_f4c4**:
   - Pros: Simple and effective for quickly adding nodes.
   - Cons: May lead to suboptimal routes as it doesn't consider future steps.

2. **Switch to another heuristic**:
   - **nearest_neighbor_99ba**: Useful for constructing routes incrementally with a focus on nearest nodes.
   - **saving_algorithm_710e**: Could be used for merging initial routes to reduce the total number of routes.
   - **two_opt_0554**: Could be used for improving the current route by reversing segments.

### Recommendation:
Given the current state and the early stage of the solution, I recommend continuing with the **greedy_f4c4** heuristic for a few more steps to further populate the routes. This will help us quickly build a more complete initial solution. After a few more steps, we can switch to more advanced heuristics like **saving_algorithm_710e** or **two_opt_0554** to refine and optimize the solution.

### Selected Heuristic and Running Steps:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_f4c4
running steps: 5
hype parameter(optional): None
explanation: Continuing with the greedy heuristic for 5 more steps will allow us to quickly add more nodes to the routes, building a more complete initial solution. After these steps, we can evaluate the progress and consider switching to other heuristics for further optimization.
