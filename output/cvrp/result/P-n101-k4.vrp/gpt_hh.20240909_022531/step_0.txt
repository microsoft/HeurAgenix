I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id

        new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id] = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]
        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

Understood, you are working on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and have built a framework to handle heuristic algorithms for solving it. Your framework includes a `Solution` class to represent the routing plan for a fleet of vehicles, and various `BaseOperator` subclasses to modify the solution, such as `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSegmentOperator`, `RelocateOperator`, and `MergeRoutesOperator`. 

You also outlined a standardized heuristic function signature that takes in global static data, current dynamic state data, algorithm-specific data, a function to generate state data for new solutions, and additional hyper-parameters. The heuristic function returns a tuple with a chosen operator and an updated algorithm data dictionary.

I will remember the details of the problem and your framework for our further discussions. When you're ready to discuss the challenges you're facing, feel free to begin the conversation, and we can work on resolving them together.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Each heuristic algorithm you have implemented has its strengths and can be best applied to specific scenarios in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The applicability of these heuristics often depends on factors such as problem size, distribution of customers, time constraints, and desired solution quality. Hereâs an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm may be particularly suitable:

1. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Larger problems where a good initial solution is desired; sparse distributions where farthest nodes might otherwise be neglected.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the average distance of nodes to the depot; higher values may favor this heuristic.

2. **Greedy (`greedy_f4c4`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Smaller problems or when a quick, decent-quality solution is needed; uniform distribution of customers.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the density of nodes; higher density may reduce the effectiveness of this heuristic.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Situations where precision is more valuable than computational speed; can be used to refine an existing solution.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate potential insertion costs for nodes; scenarios with variable insertion costs may benefit from this heuristic.

4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: When a fast solution is required; can be a good starting point for other heuristics.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the variance in distances between nodes; lower variance might make this heuristic more effective.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: To improve existing solutions by balancing loads and reducing total distance; useful in iterative optimization processes.
   - **Quantification**: Examine route efficiency and load balance; the more imbalanced the routes, the more potential for improvement.

6. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: When routes have a radial structure from the depot; useful for problems with a central depot and dispersed customers.
   - **Quantification**: Assess the geographic distribution of customers; more centralized distributions favor this heuristic.

7. **Random (`random_bfdc`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: For benchmarking other heuristics; useful when exploring the solution space non-deterministically.
   - **Quantification**: Lack of specific quantification, as randomness does not rely on problem characteristics.

8. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e` with `merge_threshold`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Medium to large problems where combining routes can lead to significant savings; effective when there's flexibility in route merging.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate savings for potential route merges; higher savings suggest greater potential for this heuristic.

9. **Three-Opt (`three_opt_e8d7`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Refinement of existing solutions; especially effective for fine-tuning routes and escaping local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the degree of route crossing or suboptimal pathing; more complex routes may see greater benefits.

10. **Two-Opt (`two_opt_0554`)**
    - **Applicable scenarios**: As a local optimization technique to improve solutions; suitable for problems of various sizes.
    - **Quantification**: Identify local suboptimalities in routes; a higher number of such instances can be an indicator for applying this heuristic.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**
    - **Applicable scenarios**: When a diverse exploration of the solution space is needed; effective in escaping local optima and finding global optima.
    - **Quantification**: Gauge the ruggedness of the solution landscape; more rugged landscapes with many local optima favor this heuristic.

These heuristics can be chosen based on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, the computational resources available, and the optimization goals (e.g., speed vs. solution quality). They can also be combined in a hyper-heuristic framework to adaptively select the most appropriate heuristic based on the current state of the solution.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Based on the given data and the current state of the solution where no routes have been built yet, we want to start constructing an initial solution that can then be refined. Given the large number of unvisited nodes (100 out of 101) and the fact that all vehicles are currently at the depot with full capacity, it may be beneficial to start with a heuristic that can provide a good initial layout of routes, considering the average demands and distance metrics provided.

Since we're at the very beginning, heuristics such as the Nearest Neighbor or Greedy might not be the best choice as they might lead to suboptimal clustering of routes, especially with a node-to-vehicle ratio as high as 25.25. On the other hand, the Farthest Insertion heuristic could be a good starting point as it tends to create more balanced routes by beginning with the most distant and difficult-to-assign nodes.

Given the global data and the current state, my recommendation is as follows:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b
running steps: 10
explanation: Starting with the Farthest Insertion heuristic allows us to place the most distant and potentially difficult nodes into routes first, which can help in avoiding suboptimal route configurations. Running it for 10 steps gives us a significant enough progression to assess its effectiveness without committing too deeply to a potentially suboptimal path.
