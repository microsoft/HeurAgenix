I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

Understood, you are working on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and have built a framework to handle heuristic algorithms for solving it. Your framework includes a `Solution` class to represent the routing plan for a fleet of vehicles, and various `BaseOperator` subclasses to modify the solution, such as `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSegmentOperator`, `RelocateOperator`, and `MergeRoutesOperator`. 

You also outlined a standardized heuristic function signature that takes in global static data, current dynamic state data, algorithm-specific data, a function to generate state data for new solutions, and additional hyper-parameters. The heuristic function returns a tuple with a chosen operator and an updated algorithm data dictionary.

I will remember the details of the problem and your framework for our further discussions. When you're ready to discuss the challenges you're facing, feel free to begin the conversation, and we can work on resolving them together.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Each heuristic algorithm you have implemented has its strengths and can be best applied to specific scenarios in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The applicability of these heuristics often depends on factors such as problem size, distribution of customers, time constraints, and desired solution quality. Hereâs an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm may be particularly suitable:

1. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Larger problems where a good initial solution is desired; sparse distributions where farthest nodes might otherwise be neglected.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the average distance of nodes to the depot; higher values may favor this heuristic.

2. **Greedy (`greedy_f4c4`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Smaller problems or when a quick, decent-quality solution is needed; uniform distribution of customers.
   - **Quantification**: Measure the density of nodes; higher density may reduce the effectiveness of this heuristic.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Situations where precision is more valuable than computational speed; can be used to refine an existing solution.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate potential insertion costs for nodes; scenarios with variable insertion costs may benefit from this heuristic.

4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: When a fast solution is required; can be a good starting point for other heuristics.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the variance in distances between nodes; lower variance might make this heuristic more effective.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: To improve existing solutions by balancing loads and reducing total distance; useful in iterative optimization processes.
   - **Quantification**: Examine route efficiency and load balance; the more imbalanced the routes, the more potential for improvement.

6. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: When routes have a radial structure from the depot; useful for problems with a central depot and dispersed customers.
   - **Quantification**: Assess the geographic distribution of customers; more centralized distributions favor this heuristic.

7. **Random (`random_bfdc`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: For benchmarking other heuristics; useful when exploring the solution space non-deterministically.
   - **Quantification**: Lack of specific quantification, as randomness does not rely on problem characteristics.

8. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e` with `merge_threshold`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Medium to large problems where combining routes can lead to significant savings; effective when there's flexibility in route merging.
   - **Quantification**: Calculate savings for potential route merges; higher savings suggest greater potential for this heuristic.

9. **Three-Opt (`three_opt_e8d7`)**
   - **Applicable scenarios**: Refinement of existing solutions; especially effective for fine-tuning routes and escaping local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the degree of route crossing or suboptimal pathing; more complex routes may see greater benefits.

10. **Two-Opt (`two_opt_0554`)**
    - **Applicable scenarios**: As a local optimization technique to improve solutions; suitable for problems of various sizes.
    - **Quantification**: Identify local suboptimalities in routes; a higher number of such instances can be an indicator for applying this heuristic.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**
    - **Applicable scenarios**: When a diverse exploration of the solution space is needed; effective in escaping local optima and finding global optima.
    - **Quantification**: Gauge the ruggedness of the solution landscape; more rugged landscapes with many local optima favor this heuristic.

These heuristics can be chosen based on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, the computational resources available, and the optimization goals (e.g., speed vs. solution quality). They can also be combined in a hyper-heuristic framework to adaptively select the most appropriate heuristic based on the current state of the solution.

Before this discuss, we have already 4 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Starting with the Farthest Insertion heuristic allows us to place the most distant and potentially difficult nodes into routes first, which can help in avoiding suboptimal route configurations. Running it for 10 steps gives us a significant enough progression to assess its effectiveness without committing too deeply to a potentially suboptimal path.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 292.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 182
---Round 1---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The Saving Algorithm heuristic is chosen to efficiently combine routes and reduce the total distance. A merge threshold is set to 0.1 to ensure that only merges with a significant saving are considered. Running this heuristic for 20 steps allows us to potentially construct new routes for the unused vehicles and improve the current solution by taking advantage of savings opportunities, while also maintaining vehicle capacity constraints.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: This heuristic is selected to quickly assign the nearest unvisited nodes to the routes of the remaining vehicles, aiming to balance the demand across the fleet and to ensure that all vehicles start contributing to the solution. A running step of 15 is chosen to make significant progress without overcommitting, allowing for future reassessment and adjustments.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 26.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 215
---Round 3---
Heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: Since we have an imbalance in vehicle utilization, the Node Shift Between Routes heuristic can help redistribute the nodes among the vehicles' routes to achieve better load balance and possibly reduce total distance. This heuristic can also help us avoid creating routes that are too long for a single vehicle to handle efficiently. Running this heuristic for 20 steps will give us a good indication of its effectiveness without overcommitting.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a. How does node_shift_between_routes_7b8a perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state of the solution, where we have a significant imbalance in vehicle utilization (one vehicle has been assigned multiple nodes while the others have none), and considering the performance of the previously applied heuristics, it seems prudent to continue refining the solution. The `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` heuristic did not result in any changes in the last round, suggesting that there may not be any beneficial shifts possible at this stage or the heuristic's parameters need adjustment.

To address the imbalance and unvisited nodes, we could employ a heuristic that starts to populate the routes for the unused vehicles in a way that balances the load and minimizes additional cost. Given that we have a high number of unvisited nodes and some vehicles with no nodes assigned yet, a constructive heuristic like `nearest_neighbor_99ba` or `greedy_f4c4` could be useful to quickly build up initial solutions for the empty vehicles. After that, we might consider applying optimization heuristics like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` to refine the solution.

However, since the `nearest_neighbor_99ba` heuristic was recently run and the `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` did not provide any improvements, I would suggest considering a heuristic that can construct routes for the empty vehicles while also considering the total cost, such as the `min_cost_insertion_7bfa`. This heuristic could help in effectively distributing the remaining nodes among the routes.

Here is my recommendation:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
running steps: 20
explanation: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic can potentially distribute the unvisited nodes to the empty vehicles' routes in a cost-effective manner. By running it for 20 steps, we can make substantial progress in constructing the routes for the remaining vehicles without overcommitting, allowing for future adjustments based on the new solution state.
***

Please proceed with the execution of the `min_cost_insertion_7bfa` heuristic for 20 steps and share the updated solution state afterward.
