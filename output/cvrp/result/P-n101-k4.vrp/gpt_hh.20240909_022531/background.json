Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of CVRP.\nA list of lists

problem.\n    - \"distance_matrix\" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.\n    - \"vehicle_num\" (int): The total number of vehicles.\n    - \"capacity\" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.\n    - \"depot\" (int): The index for depot node.\n    - \"demands\" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.\nstate_data (dict): The

representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.\n    - \"visited_num\" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.\n    - \"unvisited_nodes\" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.\n    - \"visited_num\" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.\n    - \"total_current_cost\" (int): The total cost of the current solution.\n    - \"last_visited\"

for each vehicle.\n    - \"validation_solution\" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.\nalgorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.\nget_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.\nOther hyper-parameters in kwargs.\nThe outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.\n\nPlease consider is cvrp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?\nIf you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n***is_cop:yes/no***\nEnsure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.\nIf you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***."

The heuristic function returns a tuple with a chosen operator and an updated algorithm data dictionary.\n\nI will remember the details of the problem and your framework for our further discussions.
