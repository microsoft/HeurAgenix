                "text": "Here\u2019s an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm you implemented is most applicable. I'll also suggest key metrics or quantifiable characteristics that can help determine the best scenarios for each algorithm:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - This heuristic is suitable when compact and balanced routes are critical, especially in instances with highly dispersed node locations.\n  - It is particularly effective when the problem requires a mix of exploration (selecting far nodes) and exploitation (route optimization with inter-vehicle swaps).\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **High Node Dispersion**: High variance in node locations (can be quantified using the standard deviation of node coordinates).\n  - **High Demand Heterogeneity**: Large variation in demand across nodes.\n  - **Moderate Vehicle Capacity Utilization**: When vehicles are neither heavily constrained nor underutilized (average demand per vehicle lies between 30%-70% of capacity).\n\n---\n\n### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - Best suited for instances where minimizing incremental costs for each insertion is critical, such as problems with dense clusters of nodes near the depot or along well-defined paths.\n  - Works well for problems where computational efficiency is important.\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **Clustered Node Locations**: Nodes are grouped into clusters (can be assessed using clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or k-means).\n  - **Low Node Dispersion**: Low standard deviation in node coordinates.\n  - **Moderate to High Vehicle Capacity Utilization**: Average demand per vehicle exceeds 50% of capacity but doesn\u2019t exceed capacity constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - Applicable in scenarios where node density is high and the nearest nodes are likely to form compact and efficient routes.\n  - Effective for problems with low numbers of unvisited nodes or where nodes have significantly different demands.\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **High Node Density**: Average distance between nodes is low (can be calculated using average pairwise distances).\n  - **Low Remaining Unvisited Nodes**: Number of unvisited nodes is less than 30% of total nodes.\n  - **High Demand Heterogeneity**: Large variance in node demands.\n\n---\n\n### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - Suitable for problems where merging routes for cost savings is critical, especially for problems with significant overlap in node locations for different routes.\n  - Works well when vehicle capacity constraints are not excessively tight.\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **Overlapping or Nearby Routes**: High overlap in node clusters assigned to different vehicles (can be quantified by analyzing route proximity).\n  - **Moderate to High Vehicle Capacity Utilization**: Average demand per vehicle lies between 50%-80% of capacity.\n  - **Merge Threshold Sensitivity**: Merge threshold parameter can be tuned to balance between cost savings and capacity feasibility.\n\n---\n\n### **5. `three_opt_e8d7`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - Best used for refining and improving already good solutions in the later stages of optimization.\n  - Works well for problems where small adjustments to routes can lead to significant cost savings.\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **High Initial Solution Quality**: The current solution has a relatively low cost but room for refinement (e.g., compare current total cost to a lower-bound estimate).\n  - **Moderate Node Dispersion**: Neither too clustered nor too dispersed nodes to allow meaningful 3-opt adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **6. `two_opt_0554`**\n- **Scenario**:  \n  - Suitable for compacting routes in problems where routes are already well-defined but can benefit from shorter paths between nodes.\n  - Works well for refining solutions at an intermediate stage of optimization.\n- **Key Quantifiable Characteristics**:\n  - **High Route Compactness Potential**: The sum of unnecessary detours or overlaps in the current solution is high (can be identified by calculating the difference between the current cost and the cost after applying simple greedy improvements).\n  - **Moderate Node Density**: Works best when node density is neither too low nor excessively high.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Quantifiable Metrics:\n\n| Algorithm                | Node Dispersion | Node Density | Demand Heterogeneity | Vehicle Capacity Utilization | Route Overlap/Compactness Potential |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308` | High            | Moderate     | High                  | Moderate                     | Moderate                            |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` | Low             | High         | Moderate              | Moderate to High             | Low                                 |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`   | Moderate        | High         | High                  | Moderate                     | Low                                 |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e`   | Moderate        | Moderate     | Moderate              | Moderate to High             | High                                |\n| `three_opt_e8d7`          | Moderate        | Moderate     | Low                   | Moderate                     | High                                |\n| `two_opt_0554`            | Moderate        | Moderate     | Low                   | Moderate                     | High                                |\n\nThis table can be used to assess the problem instance characteristics and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm for a given scenario."
