This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low.

This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\n\nimprovement_heuristics: These heuristics improve an existing solution by modifying node sequences to reduce total travel cost or improve compactness.\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP.

This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 2 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Each phase will involve different heuristic categories based on the problem's current state and the effectiveness of previous heuristics. Here's a proposed framework:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n\n- **Objective**: Create an initial feasible solution quickly.\n- **Heuristic Categories**: \n  - **Construction Heuristics**: Use a combination of methods to generate diverse starting points.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Apply `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` to generate an initial route that takes node demands into account.\n      2. Utilize `farthest_insertion_6308()` to explore alternative routes that might be more optimal.\n      3. Evaluate the performance of each construction heuristic based on initial solution feasibility and cost.\n      4. Select the most promising initial solution to proceed.\n\n#### Phase 2: Initial Improvement\n\n- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution to improve efficiency and cost.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Improvement Heuristics**: Focus on optimizing the sequence within existing routes.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Apply `two_opt_0554()` to perform basic route optimization.\n      2. Use `three_opt_e8d7()` if further improvements are necessary.\n      3. Assess the impact of each improvement heuristic on the total cost and compactness of routes.\n      4. Choose the best improved solution for further refinement.\n\n#### Phase 3: Advanced Improvement and Exploration\n\n- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore better solutions.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Metaheuristics**: Explore multiple neighborhoods to find global optima.\n  - **Node Relocation**: Adjust node positions across routes to balance loads.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Implement `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` to explore diverse solutions and escape local optima.\n      2. Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()` to relocate nodes for better load balancing.\n      3. Evaluate the effectiveness of these heuristics in achieving a lower cost and better solution quality.\n\n#### Phase 4: Route Merging and Final Optimization\n\n- **Objective**: Reduce the number of routes and finalize the solution.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Route Merging**: Combine routes to optimize vehicle usage.\n    - **Execution Steps**:\n      1. Apply `saving_algorithm_710e()` to merge routes where possible, considering capacity constraints.\n      2. Re-evaluate using improvement heuristics if merging creates suboptimal routes.\n      3. Finalize the solution by ensuring all nodes are serviced efficiently.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n\n- **Alternation Strategy**: Continuously alternate between different heuristic categories during each phase to avoid stagnation.\n- **Evaluation Criteria**: Regularly assess the solution based on total travel cost, vehicle load balance, and overall route efficiency.\n- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to revisit previous phases if a new heuristic reveals potential for further improvement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis strategic guide emphasizes flexibility and experimentation with various heuristics to find the most effective solution for the CVRP. By iteratively testing and evaluating different heuristic categories, you can dynamically adapt to the problem's complexities and improve solution quality over time."

We need to build a feasible initial solution by assigning nodes to vehicle routes. Starting with construction heuristics will allow us to create a baseline solution to work from. Using methods like nearest neighbor or farthest insertion will help us begin populating routes efficiently, considering vehicle capacity and node demands.\nVisited Node Num: 1->3\nCurrent Cost: 0.0->18.0\nFulfilled Demands: 0->30\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain:  The current solution is still in the early stages, with only a small fraction of nodes visited and a significant number of nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will allow us to further develop the initial solution and populate vehicle routes more effectively. This approach will help ensure that we efficiently utilize the available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Once a more comprehensive initial solution is established, we can transition to improvement heuristics or other categories to enhance and refine the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 3->5\nCurrent Cost: 18.0->32.0\nFulfilled Demands: 30->63\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain:  The current solution is still in the early stages with a significant number of nodes unvisited and a substantial remaining demand. Continuing with construction heuristics allows us to further populate the vehicle routes, ensuring that we efficiently utilize available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Completing the initial solution with construction heuristics will provide a stronger foundation for subsequent improvement phases.\nVisited Node Num: 5->7\nCurrent Cost: 32.0->40.0\nFulfilled Demands: 63->90\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain:  The current solution has started to take shape with 7 nodes visited and a total current cost of 40.0. However, a significant number of nodes remain unvisited, and there's room to optimize the already constructed routes. Switching to improvement heuristics allows us to refine the current solution by optimizing the sequence of visited nodes, reducing the total travel cost, and better utilizing the vehicle capacities. This approach will help in enhancing the existing routes before proceeding to add more nodes or consider merging routes.\nVisited Node Num: 7->9\nCurrent Cost: 40.0->55.0\nFulfilled Demands: 90->122\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, with only 9 nodes visited and a large number of unvisited nodes (92), it's important to further build the solution. Although improvement heuristics have optimized the initial routes, the focus should now return to populating more routes and visiting additional nodes. Construction heuristics will allow us to efficiently add more nodes to the existing solution, considering the vehicle capacity and demands, before returning to improvement heuristics or exploring other categories for optimization.\nVisited Node Num: 9->11\nCurrent Cost: 55.0->64.0\nFulfilled Demands: 122->172\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain:  Although some initial improvement heuristics have been applied, the solution is still in its infancy, with only 11 nodes visited and 90 nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will help further populate the vehicle routes. This approach will ensure that we efficiently utilize available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Completing the initial solution with construction heuristics will provide a stronger foundation for subsequent improvement phases.\nVisited Node Num: 11->13\nCurrent Cost: 64.0->69.0\nFulfilled Demands: 172->191\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain:  The current solution has begun to take shape, with 13 nodes visited and a single vehicle utilized, leaving a large number of nodes and vehicles unaddressed. Continuing with construction heuristics may yield diminishing returns since the current solution's foundation is sufficiently established. Switching to improvement heuristics can optimize the routes already constructed, potentially reducing costs and enhancing route efficiency. This phase can help balance vehicle loads and make better use of vehicle capacity before introducing more nodes and vehicles. After refining the existing routes, further construction or exploration of other heuristic categories could be considered.\nVisited Node Num: 13->15\nCurrent Cost: 69.0->84.0\nFulfilled Demands: 191->227\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain: With 86 nodes still unvisited and significant remaining demand, it is crucial to continue building the solution by visiting more nodes. Although improvement heuristics have optimized the existing route, the focus should shift back to construction heuristics to populate more routes and utilize the available vehicle capacity.
