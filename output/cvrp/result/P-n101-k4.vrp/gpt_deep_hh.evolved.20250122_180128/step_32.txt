I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively addressed using heuristic methods. The framework you've built seems well-structured to support various heuristic algorithms with the use of operators to modify solutions. The data structures and methods described align with typical requirements for solving CVRP using heuristic approaches.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,metaheuristics,route_merging,node_relocation

construction_heuristics: These heuristics focus on constructing an initial feasible solution by adding nodes to routes based on different criteria like nearest distance, insertion cost, or polar angle.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

improvement_heuristics: These heuristics improve an existing solution by modifying node sequences to reduce total travel cost or improve compactness.
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

metaheuristics: This heuristic employs a metaheuristic approach by systematically exploring multiple neighborhoods to escape local optima.
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

route_merging: This heuristic focuses on merging routes to reduce the number of routes and optimize the total distance by calculating potential savings.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.

node_relocation: This heuristic attempts to improve the solution by relocating nodes between different routes while considering capacity constraints.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:101
vehicle_num:4
capacity:400
depot:0
demands:[0, 10, 7, 13, 19, 26, 3, 5, 9, 16, 16, 12, 19, 23, 20, 8, 19, 2, 12, 17, 9, 11, 18, 29, 3, 6, 17, 16, 16, 9, 21, 27, 23, 11, 14, 8, 5, 8, 16, 31, 9, 5, 5, 7, 18, 16, 1, 27, 36, 30, 13, 10, 9, 14, 18, 2, 6, 7, 18, 28, 3, 13, 19, 10, 9, 20, 25, 25, 36, 6, 5, 15, 25, 9, 8, 18, 13, 14, 3, 23, 6, 26, 16, 11, 7, 41, 35, 26, 9, 15, 3, 1, 2, 22, 27, 20, 11, 12, 10, 9, 17]
average_demand:14.435643564356436
demand_variance:79.21615527889422
average_distance:33.9160396039604
max_distance:92.0
min_distance:1.0
distance_variance:267.38780213704536
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.91125
node_to_vehicle_ratio:25.25

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 2 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To strategically guide the selection of heuristic categories and define execution steps for solving the CVRP, we can break down the process into several phases. Each phase will involve different heuristic categories based on the problem's current state and the effectiveness of previous heuristics. Here's a proposed framework:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction

- **Objective**: Create an initial feasible solution quickly.
- **Heuristic Categories**: 
  - **Construction Heuristics**: Use a combination of methods to generate diverse starting points.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Apply `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` to generate an initial route that takes node demands into account.
      2. Utilize `farthest_insertion_6308()` to explore alternative routes that might be more optimal.
      3. Evaluate the performance of each construction heuristic based on initial solution feasibility and cost.
      4. Select the most promising initial solution to proceed.

#### Phase 2: Initial Improvement

- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution to improve efficiency and cost.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Improvement Heuristics**: Focus on optimizing the sequence within existing routes.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Apply `two_opt_0554()` to perform basic route optimization.
      2. Use `three_opt_e8d7()` if further improvements are necessary.
      3. Assess the impact of each improvement heuristic on the total cost and compactness of routes.
      4. Choose the best improved solution for further refinement.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Improvement and Exploration

- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore better solutions.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Metaheuristics**: Explore multiple neighborhoods to find global optima.
  - **Node Relocation**: Adjust node positions across routes to balance loads.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Implement `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` to explore diverse solutions and escape local optima.
      2. Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()` to relocate nodes for better load balancing.
      3. Evaluate the effectiveness of these heuristics in achieving a lower cost and better solution quality.

#### Phase 4: Route Merging and Final Optimization

- **Objective**: Reduce the number of routes and finalize the solution.
- **Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Route Merging**: Combine routes to optimize vehicle usage.
    - **Execution Steps**:
      1. Apply `saving_algorithm_710e()` to merge routes where possible, considering capacity constraints.
      2. Re-evaluate using improvement heuristics if merging creates suboptimal routes.
      3. Finalize the solution by ensuring all nodes are serviced efficiently.

### Iterative Approach

- **Alternation Strategy**: Continuously alternate between different heuristic categories during each phase to avoid stagnation.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Regularly assess the solution based on total travel cost, vehicle load balance, and overall route efficiency.
- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to revisit previous phases if a new heuristic reveals potential for further improvement.

### Conclusion

This strategic guide emphasizes flexibility and experimentation with various heuristics to find the most effective solution for the CVRP. By iteratively testing and evaluating different heuristic categories, you can dynamically adapt to the problem's complexities and improve solution quality over time.

Before this discuss, we have already 32 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: petal_algorithm_b384
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  The current solution is essentially at the initial stage with no nodes visited beyond the depot. We need to build a feasible initial solution by assigning nodes to vehicle routes. Starting with construction heuristics will allow us to create a baseline solution to work from. Using methods like nearest neighbor or farthest insertion will help us begin populating routes efficiently, considering vehicle capacity and node demands.
Visited Node Num: 1->3
Current Cost: 0.0->18.0
Fulfilled Demands: 0->30
---Round 1---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  The current solution is still in the early stages, with only a small fraction of nodes visited and a significant number of nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will allow us to further develop the initial solution and populate vehicle routes more effectively. This approach will help ensure that we efficiently utilize the available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Once a more comprehensive initial solution is established, we can transition to improvement heuristics or other categories to enhance and refine the solution.
Visited Node Num: 3->5
Current Cost: 18.0->32.0
Fulfilled Demands: 30->63
---Round 2---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  The current solution is still in the early stages with a significant number of nodes unvisited and a substantial remaining demand. Continuing with construction heuristics allows us to further populate the vehicle routes, ensuring that we efficiently utilize available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Completing the initial solution with construction heuristics will provide a stronger foundation for subsequent improvement phases.
Visited Node Num: 5->7
Current Cost: 32.0->40.0
Fulfilled Demands: 63->90
---Round 3---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  The current solution has started to take shape with 7 nodes visited and a total current cost of 40.0. However, a significant number of nodes remain unvisited, and there's room to optimize the already constructed routes. Switching to improvement heuristics allows us to refine the current solution by optimizing the sequence of visited nodes, reducing the total travel cost, and better utilizing the vehicle capacities. This approach will help in enhancing the existing routes before proceeding to add more nodes or consider merging routes.
Visited Node Num: 7->9
Current Cost: 40.0->55.0
Fulfilled Demands: 90->122
---Round 4---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain: Given the current state of the solution, with only 9 nodes visited and a large number of unvisited nodes (92), it's important to further build the solution. Although improvement heuristics have optimized the initial routes, the focus should now return to populating more routes and visiting additional nodes. Construction heuristics will allow us to efficiently add more nodes to the existing solution, considering the vehicle capacity and demands, before returning to improvement heuristics or exploring other categories for optimization.
Visited Node Num: 9->11
Current Cost: 55.0->64.0
Fulfilled Demands: 122->172
---Round 5---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  Although some initial improvement heuristics have been applied, the solution is still in its infancy, with only 11 nodes visited and 90 nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will help further populate the vehicle routes. This approach will ensure that we efficiently utilize available capacity while considering the demands of unvisited nodes. Completing the initial solution with construction heuristics will provide a stronger foundation for subsequent improvement phases.
Visited Node Num: 11->13
Current Cost: 64.0->69.0
Fulfilled Demands: 172->191
---Round 6---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  The current solution has begun to take shape, with 13 nodes visited and a single vehicle utilized, leaving a large number of nodes and vehicles unaddressed. Continuing with construction heuristics may yield diminishing returns since the current solution's foundation is sufficiently established. Switching to improvement heuristics can optimize the routes already constructed, potentially reducing costs and enhancing route efficiency. This phase can help balance vehicle loads and make better use of vehicle capacity before introducing more nodes and vehicles. After refining the existing routes, further construction or exploration of other heuristic categories could be considered.
Visited Node Num: 13->15
Current Cost: 69.0->84.0
Fulfilled Demands: 191->227
---Round 7---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain: With 86 nodes still unvisited and significant remaining demand, it is crucial to continue building the solution by visiting more nodes. Although improvement heuristics have optimized the existing route, the focus should shift back to construction heuristics to populate more routes and utilize the available vehicle capacity. This will establish a more comprehensive solution foundation, allowing for further refinement and optimization in subsequent phases.
Visited Node Num: 15->17
Current Cost: 84.0->100.0
Fulfilled Demands: 227->239
---Round 8---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  Given the current state of the solution, with only 17 nodes visited and a significant number of nodes remaining unvisited, it is crucial to refine the existing routes before expanding further. Switching to improvement heuristics will allow us to optimize the current routes, reduce costs, and better utilize the vehicle capacity. This refinement will provide a more efficient foundation for future construction or other heuristic applications, ultimately leading to a more optimal overall solution.
Visited Node Num: 17->19
Current Cost: 100.0->109.0
Fulfilled Demands: 239->276
---Round 9---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  Given that only 19 nodes have been visited out of 101, with a significant number of nodes (82) still unvisited, the focus should shift back to construction heuristics. This will allow for the continued development of the solution by adding more nodes to the routes. The current vehicle capacity utilization is relatively low, and additional nodes need to be assigned to vehicles to better utilize capacity and increase the total demand served. Construction heuristics can help efficiently expand the solution by exploring new nodes and incorporating them into existing routes, thereby creating a more comprehensive initial solution that can be further optimized later.
Visited Node Num: 19->21
Current Cost: 109.0->125.0
Fulfilled Demands: 276->293
---Round 10---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 2
Explain:  With 21 nodes visited and 80 nodes still unvisited, the current solution has begun to take shape. The vehicle capacity utilization for the first vehicle is relatively high, suggesting that further construction may lead to suboptimal routes due to the capacity constraints. By switching to improvement heuristics, we can optimize the current routes, reduce costs, and better utilize vehicle capacities before expanding further. This will provide a more efficient foundation for future construction or other heuristic applications.
