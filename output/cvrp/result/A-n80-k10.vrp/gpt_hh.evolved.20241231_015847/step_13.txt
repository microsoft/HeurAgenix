I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

***is_cop:yes***  

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal combination of routes for vehicles while adhering to constraints like vehicle capacity and minimizing the total distance traveled. The problem aligns well with the use of heuristics or hyper-heuristics, as exact methods can become computationally infeasible for large instances.  

The `Solution` and `Operator` framework you have described is valid for representing and modifying solutions in the context of CVRP. The operators (e.g., `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, etc.) are standard mechanisms for implementing heuristic moves, and the provided heuristic function signature aligns with the requirements of a flexible hyper-heuristic framework.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

The heuristics you have implemented for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) each have unique strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Below is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable and how these scenarios might be quantified:

---

### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308`: Farthest Insertion Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Instances with a large number of nodes spread over a wide geographical area.
  - When balancing compactness and minimizing insertion costs is important.
  - Useful for initial solutions that avoid highly compact or clustered routes.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Node Dispersion**: Measured by metrics such as the standard deviation of distances between nodes or clustering coefficients.
  - **Demand Distribution**: Works well when demands are unevenly distributed among nodes, requiring careful capacity planning.
  - **Solution Quality vs. Runtime**: Tends to provide high-quality solutions but may require more runtime due to periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.

---

### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`: Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Instances where minimizing incremental costs for inserting nodes is critical.
  - Suitable for problems with smaller node counts where computational efficiency is prioritized.
  - When demands are relatively uniform across nodes.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Distance Matrix Sparsity**: Works well when the distance matrix has clear "clusters" of low-cost nodes (e.g., nodes close to each other geographically).
  - **Node Count**: Performs better on smaller problem sizes due to reduced insertion complexity.
  - **Demand Homogeneity**: Performs well when demand variations among nodes are minimal.

---

### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9`: Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for smaller problem sizes or when a quick and simple solution is needed.
  - Effective when nodes are relatively close to each other, geographically or in terms of demand.
  - When the problem requires a fast initial solution that can be improved iteratively.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Node Density**: Works best when nodes are densely packed in a localized area.
  - **Unvisited Node Count**: Performs well in scenarios where unvisited nodes are relatively few.
  - **Demand Distribution**: Prefers higher-demand nodes when vehicle capacity is a limiting factor.

---

### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e`: Saving Algorithm Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for instances where merging routes can lead to significant cost savings.
  - Performs well for problems with a moderate number of nodes and vehicles.
  - Effective when vehicle capacity constraints are not overly restrictive.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Merge Threshold**: The savings value threshold can be adjusted to control how aggressive the heuristic is in merging routes.
  - **Route Savings Potential**: Quantified by metrics such as the average pairwise savings between routes.
  - **Capacity Utilization**: Works best when vehicle capacities are partially utilized, leaving room for merging routes.

---

### **5. `three_opt_e8d7`: 3-Opt Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Scenarios where improving an already good initial solution is the goal.
  - Suitable for refining solutions with a moderate to high number of nodes.
  - Effective when global optimization of route compactness is required.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Initial Solution Quality**: Performs better when the initial solution is already reasonably good.
  - **Route Length**: Works best for longer routes where significant improvements can be made by removing and reordering segments.
  - **Node Count**: Computationally expensive, so more effective for smaller to mid-sized problem instances.

---

### **6. `two_opt_0554`: 2-Opt Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for refining solutions with short to medium-length routes.
  - Effective for problems where route compactness is a priority.
  - Useful for improving solutions quickly without high computational cost.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Route Compactness**: Quantified by metrics such as the total distance or deviation from a straight line.
  - **Node Count per Route**: Performs well when each route contains a moderate number of nodes.
  - **Runtime Constraints**: Faster than 3-Opt and can be applied iteratively for incremental improvements.

---

### Conclusion:
Each heuristic has its strengths and is applicable to specific problem instances and scenarios. The key to using these heuristics effectively lies in understanding the characteristics of the CVRP instance (e.g., node distribution, demand patterns, capacity constraints) and choosing the heuristic that aligns best with the quantifiable metrics. Additionally, combining multiple heuristics or using them sequentially (e.g., starting with a constructive heuristic like `farthest_insertion` and refining with `two_opt`) can often yield superior results.

Before this discuss, we have already 13 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state has no nodes assigned to any vehicle and all vehicles are fully available with maximum capacity. Given the large number of unvisited nodes (79) and the relatively dispersed node demands and distances (as indicated by high variance in both), the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is a strong candidate for constructing an initial solution. It prioritizes nodes based on insertion costs, route compactness, and capacity utilization, which is suitable for this stage of the problem where the goal is to establish an initial feasible solution.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 243.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 151
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state has a partially constructed solution with 69 unvisited nodes and a total remaining demand of 791. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it works well for constructing routes incrementally by selecting the nearest unvisited nodes while considering vehicle capacity. Given the relatively high number of unvisited nodes and the need to build compact routes, this heuristic can help improve the solution efficiently. Additionally, it incorporates periodic 2-opt improvements, which can enhance route compactness during the process.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 193.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 97
---Round 2---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has a partially constructed state with 59 unvisited nodes and a total remaining demand of 694. While progress has been made, the average route length (2.0) and total current cost (436.0) suggest that there is room for improvement in route compactness and efficiency. Given the relatively moderate size of the problem and the need to refine existing routes, the `two_opt_0554` heuristic is a good candidate. It is computationally efficient for small iterative improvements and can help reduce route overlap and improve total cost. A small trial of 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding whether further refinement or switching to `three_opt_e8d7` is necessary.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -25.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: 2.0) and a partially constructed state with unvisited nodes (59) and high remaining demand (694), the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is a natural next step. It is more powerful than `two_opt_0554` for refining route structures and can potentially result in a significant cost reduction and enhanced route compactness. A small trial of 10 steps is appropriate to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding on further refinement or switching strategies.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic did not yield any improvement in terms of visited nodes, cost, or fulfilled demand in the last round, indicating that further refinement may not be effective at this stage. Instead, the focus should shift back to constructing the solution by adding more unvisited nodes to the routes. Given that there are still 59 unvisited nodes with significant remaining demand (694), the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is a good choice to incrementally build routes by prioritizing the nearest unvisited nodes, while also considering vehicle capacity. This will help in expanding the solution while maintaining compactness and efficiency. A small trial of 10 steps allows for evaluation of its performance before making further decisions.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 266.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 95
---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The last application of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` resulted in a significant increase in the number of visited nodes (+10) and fulfilled demand (+95), though at the cost of a higher total cost (+266). Given the current state with 49 unvisited nodes and substantial remaining demand (599), it is still essential to focus on expanding the solution incrementally. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic remains a strong candidate for continuing route construction, as it effectively prioritizes compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints. A trial of 10 steps will allow for further evaluation of its performance before deciding on the next steps.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently resulted in significant progress in terms of visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, albeit at the cost of increased total cost. Given the current state with 39 unvisited nodes and substantial remaining demand (493), the focus should remain on incrementally constructing the solution. `nearest_neighbor_54a9` is a strong candidate to continue this process, as it prioritizes compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints. Another 10 steps will allow us to push further progress and evaluate its diminishing returns before considering a shift to a refinement heuristic or another strategy.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently resulted in progress in terms of visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand. Although the total cost has increased, the heuristic remains effective at incrementally constructing the solution while maintaining route compactness. Given the current state with 29 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (345), it is reasonable to continue with this heuristic for another 10 steps to push further progress and evaluate its diminishing returns.

---Round 8---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently yielded progress in visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, despite the increase in total cost. Given the current state with 19 unvisited nodes and a moderate remaining demand of 194, it is reasonable to continue with this heuristic for another 10 steps. Its ability to prioritize compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints makes it a strong candidate for further expanding the solution. This step will help push closer to completing the solution while monitoring diminishing returns before considering a shift to a refinement heuristic.

---Round 9---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous rounds of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently yielded progress in visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, despite an increase in total cost. Given the current state with only 9 unvisited nodes and a moderate remaining demand of 88, the heuristic remains effective for incrementally constructing the solution. Its ability to prioritize compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints makes it a strong candidate. Running another 10 steps will help push closer to completing the solution while monitoring for diminishing returns, ensuring no unvisited nodes are left and the remaining demand is fulfilled.

---Round 10---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has all nodes visited, and the solution validity is true. However, the total cost (2201.0) and the average route length (7.9) suggest there is room for improvement in route compactness and overall efficiency. Since the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been extensively utilized in the past rounds and we are now in a refinement stage, a small trial of the `two_opt_0554` heuristic for 10 steps is appropriate. This heuristic is computationally efficient and can make incremental improvements to the route structure by reducing overlap and improving compactness. If meaningful improvements are observed, we can consider continuing or switching to `three_opt_e8d7` for deeper refinement.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -28.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 11---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has all nodes visited, and the solution validity is confirmed. The last application of `two_opt_0554` resulted in a marginal improvement in total cost (-28.0) without further changes to the solution structure. While `two_opt_0554` is computationally efficient, its incremental improvements suggest diminishing returns at this stage. A trial run of `three_opt_e8d7` for 10 steps is recommended to explore deeper route refinements. The 3-opt heuristic is more powerful for restructuring routes and can potentially yield significant cost reductions and enhanced route compactness, especially given the current average route length (7.9) and total cost (2173.0). This trial will provide insights into whether further refinement is beneficial or if the solution is near optimal.

---Round 12---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The last application of `three_opt_e8d7` did not yield any improvement in terms of total cost or solution structure, but given the nature of the 3-opt heuristic, it is capable of performing deeper route refinements that may require additional iterations to take effect. The current state, with an average route length of 7.9 and a total cost of 2173.0, still suggests room for improvement in route compactness and overall efficiency. Since `two_opt_0554` has already shown diminishing returns, running another 10 steps of `three_opt_e8d7` is recommended to explore its potential for further cost reduction and solution optimization. This will help assess whether further refinement is beneficial or if the solution is nearing optimality.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: three_opt_e8d7  
running steps: 10  
explanation: The last two rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` did not yield improvements in total cost or structure, but given its ability to perform deeper route refinements, it is worth running another 10 steps to further explore potential gains. The current state, with an average route length of 7.9 and a total cost of 2173.0, suggests there may still be room for improvement in route compactness and efficiency. If this round also fails to produce meaningful changes, it may indicate that the solution is nearing optimality or requires a different heuristic.***
