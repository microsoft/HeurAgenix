I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.

***is_cop:yes***  

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal combination of routes for vehicles while adhering to constraints like vehicle capacity and minimizing the total distance traveled. The problem aligns well with the use of heuristics or hyper-heuristics, as exact methods can become computationally infeasible for large instances.  

The `Solution` and `Operator` framework you have described is valid for representing and modifying solutions in the context of CVRP. The operators (e.g., `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, etc.) are standard mechanisms for implementing heuristic moves, and the provided heuristic function signature aligns with the requirements of a flexible hyper-heuristic framework.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

The heuristics you have implemented for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) each have unique strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Below is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable and how these scenarios might be quantified:

---

### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308`: Farthest Insertion Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Instances with a large number of nodes spread over a wide geographical area.
  - When balancing compactness and minimizing insertion costs is important.
  - Useful for initial solutions that avoid highly compact or clustered routes.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Node Dispersion**: Measured by metrics such as the standard deviation of distances between nodes or clustering coefficients.
  - **Demand Distribution**: Works well when demands are unevenly distributed among nodes, requiring careful capacity planning.
  - **Solution Quality vs. Runtime**: Tends to provide high-quality solutions but may require more runtime due to periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.

---

### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`: Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Instances where minimizing incremental costs for inserting nodes is critical.
  - Suitable for problems with smaller node counts where computational efficiency is prioritized.
  - When demands are relatively uniform across nodes.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Distance Matrix Sparsity**: Works well when the distance matrix has clear "clusters" of low-cost nodes (e.g., nodes close to each other geographically).
  - **Node Count**: Performs better on smaller problem sizes due to reduced insertion complexity.
  - **Demand Homogeneity**: Performs well when demand variations among nodes are minimal.

---

### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9`: Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for smaller problem sizes or when a quick and simple solution is needed.
  - Effective when nodes are relatively close to each other, geographically or in terms of demand.
  - When the problem requires a fast initial solution that can be improved iteratively.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Node Density**: Works best when nodes are densely packed in a localized area.
  - **Unvisited Node Count**: Performs well in scenarios where unvisited nodes are relatively few.
  - **Demand Distribution**: Prefers higher-demand nodes when vehicle capacity is a limiting factor.

---

### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e`: Saving Algorithm Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for instances where merging routes can lead to significant cost savings.
  - Performs well for problems with a moderate number of nodes and vehicles.
  - Effective when vehicle capacity constraints are not overly restrictive.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Merge Threshold**: The savings value threshold can be adjusted to control how aggressive the heuristic is in merging routes.
  - **Route Savings Potential**: Quantified by metrics such as the average pairwise savings between routes.
  - **Capacity Utilization**: Works best when vehicle capacities are partially utilized, leaving room for merging routes.

---

### **5. `three_opt_e8d7`: 3-Opt Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Scenarios where improving an already good initial solution is the goal.
  - Suitable for refining solutions with a moderate to high number of nodes.
  - Effective when global optimization of route compactness is required.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Initial Solution Quality**: Performs better when the initial solution is already reasonably good.
  - **Route Length**: Works best for longer routes where significant improvements can be made by removing and reordering segments.
  - **Node Count**: Computationally expensive, so more effective for smaller to mid-sized problem instances.

---

### **6. `two_opt_0554`: 2-Opt Heuristic**
- **Applicable Scenarios**:
  - Suitable for refining solutions with short to medium-length routes.
  - Effective for problems where route compactness is a priority.
  - Useful for improving solutions quickly without high computational cost.
- **Key Quantifiers**:
  - **Route Compactness**: Quantified by metrics such as the total distance or deviation from a straight line.
  - **Node Count per Route**: Performs well when each route contains a moderate number of nodes.
  - **Runtime Constraints**: Faster than 3-Opt and can be applied iteratively for incremental improvements.

### Conclusion:
Each heuristic has its strengths and is applicable to specific problem instances and scenarios. The key to using these heuristics effectively lies in understanding the characteristics of the CVRP instance (e.g., node distribution, demand patterns, capacity constraints) and choosing the heuristic that aligns best with the quantifiable metrics. Additionally, combining multiple heuristics or using them sequentially (e.g., starting with a constructive heuristic like `farthest_insertion` and refining with `two_opt`) can often yield superior results.
