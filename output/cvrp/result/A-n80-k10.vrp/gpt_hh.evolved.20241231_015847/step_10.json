Below is an analysis of scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable and how these scenarios might be quantified:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308`: Farthest Insertion Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Instances with a large number of nodes spread over a wide geographical area.\n  - When balancing compactness and minimizing insertion costs is important.\n  - Useful for initial solutions that avoid highly compact or clustered routes.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Node Dispersion**: Measured by metrics such as the standard deviation of distances between nodes or clustering coefficients.\n  - **Demand Distribution**: Works well when demands are unevenly distributed among nodes, requiring careful capacity planning.\n  - **Solution Quality vs. Runtime**: Tends to provide high-quality solutions but may require more runtime due to periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.\n\n---\n\n### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`: Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Instances where minimizing incremental costs for inserting nodes is critical.\n  - Suitable for problems with smaller node counts where computational efficiency is prioritized.\n  - When demands are relatively uniform across nodes.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Distance Matrix Sparsity**: Works well when the distance matrix has clear \"clusters\" of low-cost nodes (e.g., nodes close to each other geographically).\n  - **Node Count**: Performs better on smaller problem sizes due to reduced insertion complexity.\n  - **Demand Homogeneity**: Performs well when demand variations among nodes are minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9`: Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Suitable for smaller problem sizes or when a quick and simple solution is needed.\n  - Effective when nodes are relatively close to each other, geographically or in terms of demand.\n  - When the problem requires a fast initial solution that can be improved iteratively.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Node Density**: Works best when nodes are densely packed in a localized area.\n  - **Unvisited Node Count**: Performs well in scenarios where unvisited nodes are relatively few.\n  - **Demand Distribution**: Prefers higher-demand nodes when vehicle capacity is a limiting factor.\n\n---\n\n### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e`: Saving Algorithm Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Suitable for instances where merging routes can lead to significant cost savings.\n  - Performs well for problems with a moderate number of nodes and vehicles.\n  - Effective when vehicle capacity constraints are not overly restrictive.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Merge Threshold**: The savings value threshold can be adjusted to control how aggressive the heuristic is in merging routes.\n  - **Route Savings Potential**: Quantified by metrics such as the average pairwise savings between routes.\n  - **Capacity Utilization**: Works best when vehicle capacities are partially utilized, leaving room for merging routes.\n\n---\n\n### **5. `three_opt_e8d7`: 3-Opt Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Scenarios where improving an already good initial solution is the goal.\n  - Suitable for refining solutions with a moderate to high number of nodes.\n  - Effective when global optimization of route compactness is required.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Initial Solution Quality**: Performs better when the initial solution is already reasonably good.\n  - **Route Length**: Works best for longer routes where significant improvements can be made by removing and reordering segments.\n  - **Node Count**: Computationally expensive, so more effective for smaller to mid-sized problem instances.\n\n---\n\n### **6. `two_opt_0554`: 2-Opt Heuristic**\n- **Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - Suitable for refining solutions with short to medium-length routes.\n  - Effective for problems where route compactness is a priority.\n  - Useful for improving solutions quickly without high computational cost.\n- **Key Quantifiers**:\n  - **Route Compactness**: Quantified by metrics such as the total distance or deviation from a straight line.\n  - **Node Count per Route**: Performs well when each route contains a moderate number of nodes.\n  - **Runtime Constraints**: Faster than 3-Opt and can be applied iteratively for incremental improvements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table for Quantifiable Scenarios:\n\n| **Heuristic**          | **Best Scenario**                                                                                                 | **Key Metrics**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion`    | Dispersed nodes, uneven demands                                                                                 | Node Dispersion, Demand Distribution, Runtime vs. Quality                      |\n| `min_cost_insertion`    | Smaller problems, uniform demands                                                                               | Distance Matrix Sparsity, Node Count, Demand Homogeneity                       |\n| `nearest_neighbor`      | Densely packed nodes, smaller problems                                                                          | Node Density, Unvisited Node Count, Demand Distribution                        |\n| `saving_algorithm`      | Moderate-sized problems, route merging opportunities                                                           | Merge Threshold, Route Savings Potential, Capacity Utilization                 |\n| `three_opt`             | Refinement of good initial solutions, longer routes                                                            | Initial Solution Quality, Route Length, Node Count                             |\n| `two_opt`               | Quick refinement, short to medium routes                                                                       | Route Compactness, Node Count per Route, Runtime Constraints                   |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is applicable to specific problem instances and scenarios. The key to using these heuristics effectively lies in understanding the characteristics of the CVRP instance (e.g., node distribution, demand patterns, capacity constraints) and choosing the heuristic that aligns best with the quantifiable metrics. Additionally, combining multiple heuristics or using them sequentially (e.g., starting with a constructive heuristic like `farthest_insertion` and refining with `two_opt`) can often yield superior results."

Given the large number of unvisited nodes (79) and the relatively dispersed node demands and distances (as indicated by high variance in both), the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is a strong candidate for constructing an initial solution. It prioritizes nodes based on insertion costs, route compactness, and capacity utilization, which is suitable for this stage of the problem where the goal is to establish an initial feasible solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 243.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 151\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state has a partially constructed solution with 69 unvisited nodes and a total remaining demand of 791. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it works well for constructing routes incrementally by selecting the nearest unvisited nodes while considering vehicle capacity. Given the relatively high number of unvisited nodes and the need to build compact routes, this heuristic can help improve the solution efficiently. Additionally, it incorporates periodic 2-opt improvements, which can enhance route compactness during the process.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 193.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 97\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has a partially constructed state with 59 unvisited nodes and a total remaining demand of 694. While progress has been made, the average route length (2.0) and total current cost (436.0) suggest that there is room for improvement in route compactness and efficiency. Given the relatively moderate size of the problem and the need to refine existing routes, the `two_opt_0554` heuristic is a good candidate. It is computationally efficient for small iterative improvements and can help reduce route overlap and improve total cost. A small trial of 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding whether further refinement or switching to `three_opt_e8d7` is necessary.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -25.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: 2.0) and a partially constructed state with unvisited nodes (59) and high remaining demand (694), the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is a natural next step. It is more powerful than `two_opt_0554` for refining route structures and can potentially result in a significant cost reduction and enhanced route compactness. A small trial of 10 steps is appropriate to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding on further refinement or switching strategies.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic did not yield any improvement in terms of visited nodes, cost, or fulfilled demand in the last round, indicating that further refinement may not be effective at this stage. Instead, the focus should shift back to constructing the solution by adding more unvisited nodes to the routes. Given that there are still 59 unvisited nodes with significant remaining demand (694), the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is a good choice to incrementally build routes by prioritizing the nearest unvisited nodes, while also considering vehicle capacity. This will help in expanding the solution while maintaining compactness and efficiency. A small trial of 10 steps allows for evaluation of its performance before making further decisions.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 266.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 95\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The last application of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` resulted in a significant increase in the number of visited nodes (+10) and fulfilled demand (+95), though at the cost of a higher total cost (+266). Given the current state with 49 unvisited nodes and substantial remaining demand (599), it is still essential to focus on expanding the solution incrementally. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic remains a strong candidate for continuing route construction, as it effectively prioritizes compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints. A trial of 10 steps will allow for further evaluation of its performance before deciding on the next steps.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 233.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 106\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently resulted in significant progress in terms of visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, albeit at the cost of increased total cost. Given the current state with 39 unvisited nodes and substantial remaining demand (493), the focus should remain on incrementally constructing the solution. `nearest_neighbor_54a9` is a strong candidate to continue this process, as it prioritizes compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints. Another 10 steps will allow us to push further progress and evaluate its diminishing returns before considering a shift to a refinement heuristic or another strategy.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 206.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 148\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently resulted in progress in terms of visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand. Although the total cost has increased, the heuristic remains effective at incrementally constructing the solution while maintaining route compactness. Given the current state with 29 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (345), it is reasonable to continue with this heuristic for another 10 steps to push further progress and evaluate its diminishing returns.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 418.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 151\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous applications of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently yielded progress in visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, despite the increase in total cost. Given the current state with 19 unvisited nodes and a moderate remaining demand of 194, it is reasonable to continue with this heuristic for another 10 steps. Its ability to prioritize compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints makes it a strong candidate for further expanding the solution. This step will help push closer to completing the solution while monitoring diminishing returns before considering a shift to a refinement heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 338.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 106\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` have consistently yielded progress in visiting unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand, despite an increase in total cost. Given the current state with only 9 unvisited nodes and a moderate remaining demand of 88, the heuristic remains effective for incrementally constructing the solution. Its ability to prioritize compact routes and high-demand nodes while considering vehicle capacity constraints makes it a strong candidate. Running another 10 steps will help push closer to completing the solution while monitoring for diminishing returns, ensuring no unvisited nodes are left and the remaining demand is fulfilled.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 9\nDelta of Current Cost: 329.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 88\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

However, the total cost (2201.0) and the average route length (7.9) suggest there is room for improvement in route compactness and overall efficiency.

This heuristic is computationally efficient and can make incremental improvements to the route structure by reducing overlap and improving compactness. If meaningful improvements are observed, we can consider continuing or switching to `three_opt_e8d7` for deeper refinement.\n***"
