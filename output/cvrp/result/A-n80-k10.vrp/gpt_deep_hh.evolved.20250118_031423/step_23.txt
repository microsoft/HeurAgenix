I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:

            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,inter_route_operators,capacity_aware_heuristics,randomized_heuristics

construction_heuristics: these heuristics build initial solutions by inserting nodes in a specific order or based on specific criteria.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

improvement_heuristics: these heuristics focus on improving existing solutions by exploring neighborhood solutions through different operators.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

inter_route_operators: these heuristics focus on moving nodes between different routes to improve the solution quality.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.

capacity_aware_heuristics: these heuristics take vehicle capacity into consideration when making decisions.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.

randomized_heuristics: this heuristic relies on random selection and does not consistently produce high-quality solutions.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:80
vehicle_num:10
capacity:100
depot:0
demands:[0, 24, 22, 23, 5, 11, 23, 26, 9, 23, 9, 14, 16, 12, 2, 2, 6, 20, 26, 12, 15, 13, 26, 17, 7, 12, 4, 4, 20, 10, 9, 2, 9, 1, 2, 2, 12, 14, 23, 21, 13, 13, 23, 3, 6, 23, 11, 2, 7, 13, 10, 3, 6, 13, 2, 14, 7, 21, 7, 22, 13, 22, 18, 22, 6, 2, 11, 5, 9, 9, 5, 12, 2, 12, 19, 6, 14, 2, 2, 24]
average_demand:11.775
demand_variance:57.399374999999985
average_distance:51.732278481012656
max_distance:138.0
min_distance:0.0
distance_variance:610.1150340490307
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.942
node_to_vehicle_ratio:8.0

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 4 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To effectively tackle the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a strategic approach, it's essential to alternate between different heuristic categories. This iterative approach ensures diversification and avoids local minima traps. Here's a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection:

#### Initial Solution Construction
1. **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible solution that respects capacity constraints.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Construction Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Begin with a heuristic like `farthest_insertion_6308` to ensure a broad initial exploration of the solution space, particularly useful in balancing route length and capacity.
     - Evaluate the solution's feasibility and initial cost.
     - If the solution is not satisfactory, switch to `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` or `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to potentially reduce initial costs while respecting capacity constraints.

#### Initial Solution Refinement
1. **Objective**: Improve the initial solution by reducing total cost and enhancing route compactness.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Improvement Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply `two_opt_0554` for a quick improvement in route compactness.
     - Introduce `three_opt_e8d7` if further improvement is needed, as it explores more complex route changes.
     - Periodically use `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` to escape local optima by dynamically altering the neighborhood structures.

#### Inter-Route Optimization
1. **Objective**: Improve the solution by optimizing interactions between different routes.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Inter-Route Operators**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Use `saving_algorithm_710e` with a moderate merge threshold to identify and merge routes where savings are greatest, while ensuring capacity constraints are respected.
     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` to fine-tune the distribution of nodes across routes, focusing on balancing load and reducing distance.

#### Capacity-Aware Adjustments
1. **Objective**: Ensure the solution respects capacity constraints while optimizing route efficiency.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Capacity-Aware Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Reassess the use of `farthest_insertion_6308` and `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` to see if further adjustments can optimize capacity utilization.
     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` for targeted capacity-aware adjustments.

#### Exploration and Diversification
1. **Objective**: Introduce randomness to explore new areas of the solution space.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Randomized Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply `random_bfdc` sparingly to inject variability into the solution, potentially revealing promising areas of the solution space that deterministic methods might miss.
     - Use this category to escape from suboptimal solutions and initiate new cycles of construction and improvement.

### Iterative Approach:
- **Cycle**: Construct â Refine â Optimize â Adjust â Explore
- **Evaluation**: After each phase, evaluate the solution's cost, feasibility, and potential areas of improvement.
- **Switching**: Be prepared to switch categories based on the current performance and characteristics of the solution.

This strategic guide provides a framework for systematically approaching the CVRP using a variety of heuristic categories, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the solution space while respecting problem constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 23 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: petal_algorithm_b384
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain: Since the current solution does not include any nodes beyond the depot, it is essential to construct an initial feasible solution. Starting with construction heuristics, such as the farthest insertion or nearest neighbor, will allow us to build a foundation by inserting nodes into the routes while respecting capacity constraints. This approach will help establish a baseline solution that can later be refined and improved.

Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The initial solution constructed by the petal_algorithm_b384 has established a baseline. However, there is a large number of unvisited nodes (75) and significant remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to improvement_heuristics, such as the two_opt_0554 or three_opt_e8d7, can help enhance the current routes by optimizing their structure and potentially allowing for further node insertions. This approach will help improve route efficiency and reduce the total cost while gradually incorporating more nodes into the solution.

Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Heuristic Category: inter_route_operators
Running Steps: 4
Explain: The current solution has made progress with the improvement heuristics, but there are still a significant number of unvisited nodes (71) and a large amount of remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to inter_route_operators can help optimize the interactions between routes, potentially allowing for more nodes to be visited and improving the overall solution quality. This approach can help redistribute the load among vehicles more effectively while reducing the total cost.

---Round 3---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: capacity_aware_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The current solution shows that only one vehicle is used, and there are still many unvisited nodes with a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to capacity-aware heuristics can help us utilize the vehicle capacity more efficiently by re-evaluating node insertions and potential relocations while respecting the capacity constraints. This approach will help to better distribute the unvisited nodes among available vehicles and enhance the overall solution quality.

Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Heuristic Category: inter_route_operators
Running Steps: 4
Explain: The current solution has shown progress in node visitation and capacity utilization, but a significant number of nodes remain unvisited, and there is still a lot of remaining vehicle capacity. The existing solution primarily utilizes one vehicle, leaving other vehicles underutilized. Switching to inter_route_operators can help redistribute the load more effectively among the available vehicles. This approach can optimize the interactions between routes, potentially allowing for more nodes to be visited and improving the overall solution quality by balancing load and reducing the total cost.

Explain:  Given the current solution, there is still a significant number of unvisited nodes (67) and a large remaining vehicle capacity. Improvement heuristics, such as `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can help optimize the existing routes by improving route compactness and potentially allowing for more efficient node insertions. This approach is likely to enhance route efficiency, reduce total cost, and increase the number of visited nodes while maintaining feasibility.

Running Steps: 4
Explain:  Given the current state, there is still a significant number of unvisited nodes (63) and a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity across most vehicles. While improvement heuristics have made some progress, focusing on capacity-aware heuristics could help better distribute unvisited nodes among the available vehicles. This approach will allow us to fully utilize the capacity, potentially reducing the number of unvisited nodes and enhancing the overall solution quality. Specifically, using capacity-aware strategies can help ensure that vehicles are loaded closer to their capacity, thus improving efficiency and reducing total cost.

Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  Given the current state of the solution, with a significant number of unvisited nodes (63) and a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity, continuing with improvement heuristics can optimize the existing routes. This category, particularly with heuristics like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can enhance route compactness and potentially allow for more efficient node insertions. This approach is likely to increase the number of visited nodes, improve route efficiency, and reduce total cost while maintaining solution feasibility.

---Round 8---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Heuristic Category: capacity_aware_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The current solution has utilized only three vehicles significantly, leaving the rest underutilized. Since there is still a substantial number of unvisited nodes (59) and a large amount of remaining vehicle capacity, it's beneficial to switch to capacity-aware heuristics. This category will help us better distribute the unvisited nodes among the available vehicles, ensuring full utilization of vehicle capacity. By doing so, we can potentially reduce the number of unvisited nodes, increase the total demand served, and improve overall solution quality.
Visited Node Num: 21->25
Current Cost: 397.0->433.0
Fulfilled Demands: 235->298
---Round 9---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Heuristic Category: inter_route_operators
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  With a significant number of unvisited nodes (55) and underutilized vehicles, focusing on inter-route operators can help redistribute the load more effectively among the available vehicles. This approach can optimize interactions between routes, allowing for more nodes to be visited and improving the overall solution quality by balancing load and reducing the total cost. By enhancing the collaboration between routes, we can better utilize remaining capacities and potentially decrease the number of unvisited nodes.

Heuristic Category: capacity_aware_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  Given the current state, there is a substantial number of unvisited nodes (55) and a large amount of remaining vehicle capacity across most vehicles. Focusing on capacity-aware heuristics can help better distribute unvisited nodes among the underutilized vehicles. This approach will allow us to fully utilize vehicle capacity, potentially reducing the number of unvisited nodes and enhancing the overall solution quality. By ensuring that vehicles are loaded closer to their capacity, we can improve efficiency and reduce total cost, especially since the last heuristic application did not alter the solution.

Heuristic Category: capacity_aware_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The current solution shows that four vehicles are significantly utilized, while six remain unused, and there are still 52 unvisited nodes. The vehicle capacity utilization is not maximized, and capacity-aware heuristics can help further distribute the unvisited nodes among the available vehicles. This approach will ensure that the vehicles are loaded closer to their capacity, which could reduce the number of unvisited nodes and enhance the overall solution quality. By focusing on capacity-aware strategies, we can improve efficiency and potentially reduce the total cost.

Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain: Given the current state, you have a significant number of unvisited nodes (48) and a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity across several underutilized vehicles. The previous application of capacity-aware heuristics has helped increase the number of visited nodes, but further optimization is necessary to enhance route efficiency and reduce total cost. Improvement heuristics, such as `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can help optimize the existing routes by improving route compactness and potentially allowing for more efficient node insertions. This approach is likely to increase the number of visited nodes, improve route efficiency, and reduce total cost while maintaining solution feasibility.

Heuristic Category: capacity_aware_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  Given the current state, there are 44 unvisited nodes and several underutilized vehicles. The last improvement heuristic increased the number of visited nodes but also significantly raised the total cost. Switching to capacity-aware heuristics can help redistribute unvisited nodes among the underutilized vehicles, ensuring better capacity utilization. This approach can potentially reduce the number of unvisited nodes and improve the overall efficiency of the solution by maximizing the use of vehicle capacity and minimizing additional costs.

Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The current solution has made progress in terms of the number of visited nodes and total demand served, but there are still 40 unvisited nodes and a significant amount of remaining vehicle capacity across most vehicles. The last use of capacity-aware heuristics increased the number of visited nodes but also led to a relatively high total cost. Switching to improvement heuristics can help optimize the existing routes, improve route compactness, and potentially allow for more efficient node insertions. This approach is likely to enhance route efficiency, reduce the total cost, and increase the number of visited nodes while maintaining solution feasibility.

Explain:  The current solution shows that four vehicles are significantly utilized while the remaining six are underutilized. With 36 unvisited nodes and a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity, switching to inter-route operators can help redistribute the load more effectively among the available vehicles. This approach can optimize interactions between routes, allowing for more nodes to be visited and improving the overall solution quality by balancing load and reducing the total cost. By focusing on inter-route strategies, we can better utilize the remaining capacities and potentially decrease the number of unvisited nodes.

Running Steps: 4
Explain:  The current solution shows that there are still 36 unvisited nodes and significant remaining vehicle capacity across several vehicles. The last heuristic did not change the number of visited nodes or the total cost, indicating that further inter-route adjustments may not be as beneficial at this stage. Switching to improvement heuristics can help enhance route efficiency and compactness, allowing for more nodes to be visited within the existing routes. This approach will focus on optimizing the structure of current routes to potentially reduce total cost and increase the number of visited nodes while maintaining solution feasibility.

Running Steps: 4
Explain: The current solution has utilized only half of the available vehicles, with many underutilized vehicles having significant remaining capacity. Given the large number of unvisited nodes (32) and a substantial total remaining demand (374), switching to capacity-aware heuristics can help distribute these unvisited nodes among the underutilized vehicles. This approach will ensure better vehicle capacity utilization, potentially reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving the overall solution quality by maximizing the use of vehicle capacity and minimizing additional costs.

Explain: The current solution has made significant progress, but there are still 24 unvisited nodes and several vehicles with remaining capacity. Inter-route operators can help optimize the load distribution among vehicles and potentially incorporate some of the unvisited nodes. This approach focuses on improving the collaboration between routes, which can enhance the overall solution quality by effectively utilizing remaining vehicle capacities and potentially reducing the total cost.

Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 4
Explain:  With 20 unvisited nodes remaining and a total current cost of 1540.0, the solution appears to be feasible but still has room for cost optimization and increased node coverage. The current average vehicle load is relatively high, indicating that the vehicle capacities are being utilized effectively. However, the average route cost is still significant, suggesting that the solution can benefit from route optimization. Switching to improvement heuristics, such as `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can help refine the existing routes by reducing route length and compactness, potentially allowing for additional node insertions or cost reductions. This approach will focus on enhancing route efficiency, improving overall solution quality, and reducing the total cost while maintaining feasibility.
