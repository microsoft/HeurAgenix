I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,inter_route_operators,capacity_aware_heuristics,randomized_heuristics

construction_heuristics: these heuristics build initial solutions by inserting nodes in a specific order or based on specific criteria.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

improvement_heuristics: these heuristics focus on improving existing solutions by exploring neighborhood solutions through different operators.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

inter_route_operators: these heuristics focus on moving nodes between different routes to improve the solution quality.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.

capacity_aware_heuristics: these heuristics take vehicle capacity into consideration when making decisions.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.

randomized_heuristics: this heuristic relies on random selection and does not consistently produce high-quality solutions.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:80
vehicle_num:10
capacity:100
depot:0
demands:[0, 24, 22, 23, 5, 11, 23, 26, 9, 23, 9, 14, 16, 12, 2, 2, 6, 20, 26, 12, 15, 13, 26, 17, 7, 12, 4, 4, 20, 10, 9, 2, 9, 1, 2, 2, 12, 14, 23, 21, 13, 13, 23, 3, 6, 23, 11, 2, 7, 13, 10, 3, 6, 13, 2, 14, 7, 21, 7, 22, 13, 22, 18, 22, 6, 2, 11, 5, 9, 9, 5, 12, 2, 12, 19, 6, 14, 2, 2, 24]
average_demand:11.775
demand_variance:57.399374999999985
average_distance:51.732278481012656
max_distance:138.0
min_distance:0.0
distance_variance:610.1150340490307
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.942
node_to_vehicle_ratio:8.0

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 4 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To effectively tackle the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a strategic approach, it's essential to alternate between different heuristic categories. This iterative approach ensures diversification and avoids local minima traps. Here's a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection:

#### Initial Solution Construction
1. **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible solution that respects capacity constraints.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Construction Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Begin with a heuristic like `farthest_insertion_6308` to ensure a broad initial exploration of the solution space, particularly useful in balancing route length and capacity.
     - Evaluate the solution's feasibility and initial cost.
     - If the solution is not satisfactory, switch to `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` or `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to potentially reduce initial costs while respecting capacity constraints.

#### Initial Solution Refinement
1. **Objective**: Improve the initial solution by reducing total cost and enhancing route compactness.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Improvement Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply `two_opt_0554` for a quick improvement in route compactness.
     - Introduce `three_opt_e8d7` if further improvement is needed, as it explores more complex route changes.
     - Periodically use `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` to escape local optima by dynamically altering the neighborhood structures.

#### Inter-Route Optimization
1. **Objective**: Improve the solution by optimizing interactions between different routes.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Inter-Route Operators**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Use `saving_algorithm_710e` with a moderate merge threshold to identify and merge routes where savings are greatest, while ensuring capacity constraints are respected.
     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` to fine-tune the distribution of nodes across routes, focusing on balancing load and reducing distance.

#### Capacity-Aware Adjustments
1. **Objective**: Ensure the solution respects capacity constraints while optimizing route efficiency.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Capacity-Aware Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Reassess the use of `farthest_insertion_6308` and `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` to see if further adjustments can optimize capacity utilization.
     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` for targeted capacity-aware adjustments.

#### Exploration and Diversification
1. **Objective**: Introduce randomness to explore new areas of the solution space.
2. **Heuristic Category**: **Randomized Heuristics**
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply `random_bfdc` sparingly to inject variability into the solution, potentially revealing promising areas of the solution space that deterministic methods might miss.
     - Use this category to escape from suboptimal solutions and initiate new cycles of construction and improvement.

### Iterative Approach:
- **Cycle**: Construct → Refine → Optimize → Adjust → Explore
- **Evaluation**: After each phase, evaluate the solution's cost, feasibility, and potential areas of improvement.
- **Switching**: Be prepared to switch categories based on the current performance and characteristics of the solution.

This strategic guide provides a framework for systematically approaching the CVRP using a variety of heuristic categories, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the solution space while respecting problem constraints.

The last heuristic category is: None(None). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,inter_route_operators,capacity_aware_heuristics,randomized_heuristics

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:construction_heuristics
explanation:Since the current solution does not include any nodes beyond the depot, it is essential to construct an initial feasible solution. Starting with construction heuristics, such as the farthest insertion or nearest neighbor, will allow us to build a foundation by inserting nodes into the routes while respecting capacity constraints. This approach will help establish a baseline solution that can later be refined and improved.
