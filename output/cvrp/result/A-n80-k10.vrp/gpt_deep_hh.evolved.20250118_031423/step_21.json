Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 4 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Starting with construction heuristics, such as the farthest insertion or nearest neighbor, will allow us to build a foundation by inserting nodes into the routes while respecting capacity constraints. This approach will help establish a baseline solution that can later be refined and improved.\nVisited Node Num: 1->5\nCurrent Cost: 0.0->92.0\nFulfilled Demands: 0->50\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 4\nExplain:  The initial solution constructed by the petal_algorithm_b384 has established a baseline. However, there is a large number of unvisited nodes (75) and significant remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to improvement_heuristics, such as the two_opt_0554 or three_opt_e8d7, can help enhance the current routes by optimizing their structure and potentially allowing for further node insertions. This approach will help improve route efficiency and reduce the total cost while gradually incorporating more nodes into the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 5->9\nCurrent Cost: 92.0->137.0\nFulfilled Demands: 50->90\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nHeuristic Category: inter_route_operators\nRunning Steps: 4\nExplain: The current solution has made progress with the improvement heuristics, but there are still a significant number of unvisited nodes (71) and a large amount of remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to inter_route_operators can help optimize the interactions between routes, potentially allowing for more nodes to be visited and improving the overall solution quality.

Switching to capacity-aware heuristics can help us utilize the vehicle capacity more efficiently by re-evaluating node insertions and potential relocations while respecting the capacity constraints. This approach will help to better distribute the unvisited nodes among available vehicles and enhance the overall solution quality.\nVisited Node Num: 9->13\nCurrent Cost: 137.0->234.0\nFulfilled Demands: 90->137\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nHeuristic Category: inter_route_operators\nRunning Steps: 4\nExplain: The current solution has shown progress in node visitation and capacity utilization, but a significant number of nodes remain unvisited, and there is still a lot of remaining vehicle capacity. The existing solution primarily utilizes one vehicle, leaving other vehicles underutilized. Switching to inter_route_operators can help redistribute the load more effectively among the available vehicles.

While improvement heuristics have made some progress, focusing on capacity-aware heuristics could help better distribute unvisited nodes among the available vehicles. This approach will allow us to fully utilize the capacity, potentially reducing the number of unvisited nodes and enhancing the overall solution quality. Specifically, using capacity-aware strategies can help ensure that vehicles are loaded closer to their capacity, thus improving efficiency and reducing total cost.\nVisited Node Num: 17->17\nCurrent Cost: 296.0->258.0\nFulfilled Demands: 186->186\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 4\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, with a significant number of unvisited nodes (63) and a substantial amount of remaining vehicle capacity, continuing with improvement heuristics can optimize the existing routes. This category, particularly with heuristics like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can enhance route compactness and potentially allow for more efficient node insertions.

The previous application of capacity-aware heuristics has helped increase the number of visited nodes, but further optimization is necessary to enhance route efficiency and reduce total cost. Improvement heuristics, such as `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, can help optimize the existing routes by improving route compactness and potentially allowing for more efficient node insertions.

The last use of capacity-aware heuristics increased the number of visited nodes but also led to a relatively high total cost. Switching to improvement heuristics can help optimize the existing routes, improve route compactness, and potentially allow for more efficient node insertions.
