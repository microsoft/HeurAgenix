I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, subject to vehicle capacity constraints, which is characteristic of combinatorial operation problems. The use of heuristics to solve CVRP is a common approach, as these problems are NP-hard, meaning that exact solutions are computationally expensive for large instances. The framework you've described with solutions, operators, and heuristic function signatures aligns with the typical methodology used to tackle such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is applicable involves understanding their strengths and weaknesses. These scenarios are often characterized by factors like problem size, node distribution, and specific constraints. Here's an analysis of the heuristics you've mentioned:

1. **Farthest Insertion**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective when you want to ensure that distant nodes are included early in the solution construction process.
   - **Best for**: Problems where nodes are scattered far from the depot and you want to minimize long detours later in the solution.

2. **Greedy**: 
   - **Scenario**: Quick construction of initial solutions by focusing on immediate cost.
   - **Best for**: Smaller problems or as a starting point for more sophisticated algorithms due to its simplicity and speed.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion**:
   - **Scenario**: Incrementally builds routes by inserting nodes at the least additional cost.
   - **Best for**: Situations where minimizing incremental distance or cost is crucial, often used for initial solution construction.

4. **Nearest Neighbor**:
   - **Scenario**: Sequentially adds the nearest node to the current route.
   - **Best for**: Problems where nodes are relatively evenly distributed and proximity is a good heuristic for minimizing total distance.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes**:
   - **Scenario**: Improves existing solutions by rebalancing routes.
   - **Best for**: Problems where initial solutions are unbalanced in terms of load or distance, and improvement through reallocation is possible.

6. **Petal Algorithm**:
   - **Scenario**: Constructs feasible routes by creating loops or "petals" around the depot.
   - **Best for**: Problems where routes naturally form around a central depot, benefiting from local loops.

7. **Random**:
   - **Scenario**: Generates diverse initial solutions without any bias.
   - **Best for**: Providing varied starting points for metaheuristic algorithms that rely on population diversity, like genetic algorithms.

8. **Saving Algorithm**:
   - **Scenario**: Merges routes based on calculated savings.
   - **Best for**: Situations where merging routes is beneficial and can significantly reduce total travel distance.

9. **Three-opt**:
   - **Scenario**: Optimizes routes by removing three edges and reconnecting them for potential cost reduction.
   - **Best for**: Problems where local optimization can yield significant improvements, especially for medium to large-sized problems.

10. **Two-opt**:
    - **Scenario**: Simplifies route optimization by removing two edges and reconnecting them.
    - **Best for**: Problems needing fast local optimization, often used as a refinement step after initial solution construction.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search**:
    - **Scenario**: Escapes local optima by systematically changing neighborhood structures.
    - **Best for**: Large and complex problems where traditional local search may get stuck in suboptimal solutions.

These heuristics can be used in isolation or combined in hybrid approaches, depending on the specific characteristics and constraints of the CVRP instance being solved.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: farthest_insertion_ce2b. How does farthest_insertion_ce2b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state data and the recent application of the Farthest Insertion heuristic, here's an evaluation and recommendation for the next steps:

- **Current Situation**: After applying the Farthest Insertion heuristic, there has been significant progress in terms of the number of visited nodes and fulfilled demands. However, the total current cost has increased, indicating that while the routes are being expanded, they are not necessarily optimized for cost efficiency.
  
- **Next Steps**: Since the Farthest Insertion heuristic has effectively increased the number of visited nodes, it may be beneficial to now refine these routes to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization. A local optimization heuristic like the Two-opt or Three-opt could be appropriate for this purpose, as they are designed to improve route efficiency without changing the overall structure significantly.

**Recommendation**:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
running steps: 20
hype parameter(optional): 
explanation: Following the Farthest Insertion heuristic, the current focus should be on optimizing the expanded routes to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The Three-opt heuristic is selected for its ability to make more substantial local adjustments compared to Two-opt, potentially leading to significant cost reductions and better utilization of vehicle capacities.
