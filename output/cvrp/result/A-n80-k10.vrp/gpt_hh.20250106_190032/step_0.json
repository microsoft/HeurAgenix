This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

These scenarios are often characterized by factors like problem size, node distribution, and specific constraints. Here's an analysis of the heuristics you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Farthest Insertion**: \n   - **Scenario**: Effective when you want to ensure that distant nodes are included early in the solution construction process.\n   - **Best for**: Problems where nodes are scattered far from the depot and you want to minimize long detours later in the solution.\n\n2. **Greedy**: \n   - **Scenario**: Quick construction of initial solutions by focusing on immediate cost.\n   - **Best for**: Smaller problems or as a starting point for more sophisticated algorithms due to its simplicity and speed.\n\n3. **Min-Cost Insertion**:\n   - **Scenario**: Incrementally builds routes by inserting nodes at the least additional cost.\n   - **Best for**: Situations where minimizing incremental distance or cost is crucial, often used for initial solution construction.\n\n4. **Nearest Neighbor**:\n   - **Scenario**: Sequentially adds the nearest node to the current route.\n   - **Best for**: Problems where nodes are relatively evenly distributed and proximity is a good heuristic for minimizing total distance.\n\n5. **Node Shift Between Routes**:\n   - **Scenario**: Improves existing solutions by rebalancing routes.\n   - **Best for**: Problems where initial solutions are unbalanced in terms of load or distance, and improvement through reallocation is possible.\n\n6. **Petal Algorithm**:\n   - **Scenario**: Constructs feasible routes by creating loops or \"petals\" around the depot.\n   - **Best for**: Problems where routes naturally form around a central depot, benefiting from local loops.\n\n7. **Random**:\n   - **Scenario**: Generates diverse initial solutions without any bias.\n   - **Best for**: Providing varied starting points for metaheuristic algorithms that rely on population diversity, like genetic algorithms.\n\n8. **Saving Algorithm**:\n   - **Scenario**: Merges routes based on calculated savings.\n   - **Best for**: Situations where merging routes is beneficial and can significantly reduce total travel distance.\n\n9. **Three-opt**:\n   - **Scenario**: Optimizes routes by removing three edges and reconnecting them for potential cost reduction.\n   - **Best for**: Problems where local optimization can yield significant improvements, especially for medium to large-sized problems.\n\n10. **Two-opt**:\n    - **Scenario**: Simplifies route optimization by removing two edges and reconnecting them.\n    - **Best for**: Problems needing fast local optimization, often used as a refinement step after initial solution construction.\n\n11. **Variable Neighborhood Search**:\n    - **Scenario**: Escapes local optima by systematically changing neighborhood structures.\n    - **Best for**: Large and complex problems where traditional local search may get stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\nThese heuristics can be used in isolation or combined in hybrid approaches, depending on the specific characteristics and constraints of the CVRP instance being solved."
