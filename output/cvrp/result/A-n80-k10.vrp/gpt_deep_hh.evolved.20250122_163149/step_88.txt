I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,metaheuristics,route_merging_heuristics,randomized_methods

construction_heuristics: suitable for constructing initial solutions by progressively building routes, focusing on insertion strategies and nearest neighbor approaches.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

improvement_heuristics: focus on improving existing solutions by exploring local search neighborhoods and applying k-opt moves.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

metaheuristics: utilizes systematic neighborhood change to escape local optima and explore the solution space more broadly.
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

route_merging_heuristics: focus on combining and optimizing routes to reduce total cost, leveraging savings and node shifts.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.

randomized_methods: relies on random selection, generally less powerful as it lacks systematic strategy.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:80
vehicle_num:10
capacity:100
depot:0
demands:[0, 24, 22, 23, 5, 11, 23, 26, 9, 23, 9, 14, 16, 12, 2, 2, 6, 20, 26, 12, 15, 13, 26, 17, 7, 12, 4, 4, 20, 10, 9, 2, 9, 1, 2, 2, 12, 14, 23, 21, 13, 13, 23, 3, 6, 23, 11, 2, 7, 13, 10, 3, 6, 13, 2, 14, 7, 21, 7, 22, 13, 22, 18, 22, 6, 2, 11, 5, 9, 9, 5, 12, 2, 12, 19, 6, 14, 2, 2, 24]
average_demand:11.775
demand_variance:57.399374999999985
average_distance:51.732278481012656
max_distance:138.0
min_distance:0.0
distance_variance:610.1150340490307
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.942
node_to_vehicle_ratio:8.0

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for the CVRP, we should focus on a phased approach, considering both the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic category. Here is a suggested framework:

### Initial Solution Construction Phase
1. **Objective**: Construct a feasible initial solution quickly to provide a starting point for further refinement.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Construction Heuristics**: Start with construction heuristics to generate an initial solution. Consider testing multiple construction heuristics to evaluate their effectiveness.
     - **Execution Steps**:
       - Begin with a greedy approach like `greedy_f4c4` to get a quick, basic solution.
       - Test `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to see if it provides a better initial setup by leveraging node demands and route compactness.
       - Experiment with `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` to explore different insertion strategies and assess the impact on initial solution quality.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the initial solutions based on cost, feasibility, and capacity constraints.

### Initial Improvement Phase
1. **Objective**: Enhance the initial solution by exploring local optimizations to reduce total cost and improve feasibility.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Improvement Heuristics**: Apply local search techniques to refine the initial solution.
     - **Execution Steps**:
       - Begin with `two_opt_0554` to improve route compactness and reduce distances.
       - Follow up with `three_opt_e8d7` for a more thorough search, allowing for more complex rearrangements.
3. **Evaluation**: Monitor the convergence speed and quality of improvements. If progress stalls, consider alternative strategies.

### Advanced Improvement Phase
1. **Objective**: Broaden the search to escape local optima and explore the solution space more thoroughly.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Metaheuristics**: Utilize more sophisticated approaches to explore beyond local optima.
     - **Execution Steps**:
       - Implement `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` to systematically explore new solution neighborhoods and escape local traps.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess whether these methods lead to significant improvements over local search methods.

### Route Optimization Phase
1. **Objective**: Optimize the routes by merging and reorganizing them to achieve a more efficient overall solution.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Route Merging Heuristics**: Focus on combining and reorganizing routes for cost savings.
     - **Execution Steps**:
       - Apply `saving_algorithm_710e` to merge routes based on calculated savings and vehicle capacity constraints.
       - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` to fine-tune node positions between routes for better load balancing.
3. **Evaluation**: Check if route merging reduces costs and improves load distribution.

### Exploration and Diversification Phase
1. **Objective**: Explore the solution space more randomly to avoid premature convergence and discover new potential solutions.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Randomized Methods**: Introduce randomness to explore diverse solutions.
     - **Execution Steps**:
       - Test `random_bfdc` to introduce variability and assess its impact on potential new solutions.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the variability introduced and determine if new promising areas of the solution space are discovered.

### Continuous Improvement Cycle
1. **Objective**: Iterate between different heuristics to continuously improve the solution.
2. **Execution Steps**:
   - Alternate between construction and improvement heuristics, adjusting the approach based on performance feedback.
   - Experiment with different combinations and sequences of heuristics to identify effective strategies.
3. **Evaluation**: Regularly assess solution quality, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency to guide future iterations.

By following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore and optimize the CVRP solution space, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories in a phased manner. This approach will provide flexibility to adapt based on performance feedback and encourage experimentation with various algorithm types.

Explain:  Since the current solution is essentially non-existent (all vehicles returning immediately to the depot without visiting any nodes), it is crucial to first establish a feasible initial solution. Construction heuristics are designed to create initial solutions by progressively building routes. Starting with a construction heuristic will allow us to allocate nodes to vehicle routes and establish a base solution upon which improvements can be made. Once a feasible initial solution is obtained, we can proceed with improvement or other heuristic categories to refine it further.
