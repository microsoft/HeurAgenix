This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\n\nimprovement_heuristics: focus on improving existing solutions by exploring local search neighborhoods and applying k-opt moves.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nmetaheuristics: utilizes systematic neighborhood change to escape local optima and explore the solution space more broadly.\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nroute_merging_heuristics: focus on combining and optimizing routes to reduce total cost, leveraging savings and node shifts.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\n\nrandomized_methods: relies on random selection, generally less powerful as it lacks systematic strategy.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nnode_num:80\nvehicle_num:10\ncapacity:100\ndepot:0\ndemands:[0, 24, 22, 23, 5, 11, 23, 26, 9, 23, 9, 14, 16, 12, 2, 2, 6, 20, 26, 12, 15, 13, 26, 17, 7, 12, 4, 4, 20, 10, 9, 2, 9, 1, 2, 2, 12, 14, 23, 21, 13, 13, 23, 3, 6, 23, 11, 2, 7, 13, 10, 3, 6, 13, 2, 14, 7, 21, 7, 22, 13, 22, 18, 22, 6, 2, 11, 5, 9, 9, 5, 12, 2, 12, 19, 6, 14, 2, 2, 24]\naverage_demand:11.775\ndemand_variance:57.399374999999985\naverage_distance:51.732278481012656\nmax_distance:138.0\nmin_distance:0.0\ndistance_variance:610.1150340490307\nvehicle_capacity_utilization:0.942\nnode_to_vehicle_ratio:8.0\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Once a more substantial portion of nodes is visited, we can then consider switching to improvement or other heuristic categories to refine and enhance the solution further.\nVisited Node Num: 9->10\nCurrent Cost: 116.0->127.0\nFulfilled Demands: 90->95\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution has only 10 out of 80 nodes visited, with a large number of nodes still unvisited, and most vehicles have not been utilized. Continuing with the construction heuristics will allow us to allocate more nodes to the routes, ensuring that demands are progressively met and the solution becomes more complete. Once a more substantial portion of nodes is visited and the initial solution is more developed, we can consider switching to improvement heuristics to refine and optimize the solution further.\nVisited Node Num: 10->11\nCurrent Cost: 127.0->135.0\nFulfilled Demands: 95->100\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has only 11 out of 80 nodes visited, and the solution is still in its early stages with a substantial number of nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will help to progressively allocate more nodes to vehicle routes and meet additional demands. This approach will allow us to further develop the initial solution, ensuring that a more complete and feasible solution is established before transitioning to other heuristic categories for refinement.\nVisited Node Num: 11->12\nCurrent Cost: 135.0->199.0\nFulfilled Demands: 100->113\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nvehicle_0: 0->40->13->42->51->77->70->67->36->73->49->0\nvehicle_1: 0->21->0\nvehicle_2: 0->0\nvehicle_3: 0->0\nvehicle_4: 0->0\nvehicle_5: 0->0\nvehicle_6: 0->0\nvehicle_7: 0->0\nvehicle_8: 0->0\nvehicle_9: 0->0\n\nvisited_nodes:[0, 67, 36, 70, 40, 73, 42, 77, 13, 49, 51, 21]\nvisited_num:12\nunvisited_nodes:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79]\nunvisited_num:68\ntotal_current_cost:199.0\nlast_visited:[40, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nvehicle_loads:[100, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nvehicle_remaining_capacity:[0, 87, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]\naverage_route_length:2.1\nmax_route_length:11\nmin_route_length:1\nstd_dev_route_length:2.981610303175115\naverage_route_cost:74.0\ntotal_demand_served:113\naverage_vehicle_load:11.3\naverage_remaining_vehicle_capacity:88.7\nnumber_of_unvisited_nodes:68\naverage_unvisited_node_demand:12.191176470588236\ntotal_remaining_demand:829\nsolution_validity:True\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: min_cost_insertion_3b2b(construction_heuristics).
