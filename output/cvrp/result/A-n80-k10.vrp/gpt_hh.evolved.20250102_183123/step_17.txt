I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""

        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):

        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP). It involves finding an optimal combination of routes for a fleet of vehicles to minimize costs (e.g., distance or time) while satisfying constraints such as vehicle capacities and customer demands. Heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are widely used for solving CVRP because of its computational complexity (it belongs to the NP-hard class of problems). 

Your Solution and Operator framework, along with the standardized heuristic function signature, appears to be correctly designed for addressing this problem.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is applicable involves understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and characteristics. Below is an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios where they are most effective, along with quantifiable factors to determine their applicability:

---

### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308()`**
- **Introduction**: This heuristic focuses on selecting unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It also includes greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Sparse networks**: Where nodes are widely spread, and the farthest insertion can help minimize long connections in the route.
  - **High vehicle utilization**: When compactness and capacity management are critical, such as when total demand is close to the total vehicle capacity.
  - **Large problem size**: Suitable for larger instances where local improvements like swaps can make a significant difference.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Node density: Low node density (distance between nodes is high).
  - Demand-to-capacity ratio: High ratio (e.g., total demand is close to total vehicle capacity).
  - Number of nodes: Suitable for larger node sets (e.g., >50 nodes).

---

### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()`**
- **Introduction**: Optimized for performance, this heuristic seeks to minimize insertion costs and uses efficient logic to enhance the solution.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **High-density networks**: Where nodes are closer to each other, making insertion cost minimization highly effective.
  - **Tight deadlines**: When computational efficiency is important due to time constraints.
  - **Low complexity required**: Suitable as an initial heuristic to generate a feasible solution quickly for further refinement.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Node density: High node density (short average distance between nodes).
  - Problem size: Medium-sized problems (e.g., 20-100 nodes) where computational efficiency is important.

---

### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9()`**
- **Introduction**: Prioritizes nodes with higher demands and applies a 2-opt heuristic for compactness.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Small to medium problem size**: Performs well in small to moderately sized instances where greedy selection is feasible.
  - **High demand variance**: When nodes have varying demands, and prioritizing higher-demand nodes improves capacity usage.
  - **Compact networks**: Suitable for networks where nodes are relatively close, and compact routes are desired.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Number of nodes: Small to medium instances (e.g., <50 nodes).
  - Demand variance: High variance in demand across nodes.
  - Node density: High or medium density.

---

### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold=0.0)`**
- **Introduction**: Merges routes based on savings, considering capacity constraints.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **High vehicle count**: Effective in reducing the number of routes when vehicles are underutilized.
  - **Homogeneous demand**: Works well when demand per node is relatively uniform, as merging routes becomes simpler to manage.
  - **Flexible thresholds**: The merge threshold can be adjusted for different problem complexities.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Vehicle utilization: Low utilization (e.g., vehicles are operating far below capacity).
  - Demand uniformity: Low variance in demand across nodes.
  - Merge threshold: A higher threshold can reduce aggressive merging for tighter constraints.

---

### **5. `three_opt_e8d7()`**
- **Introduction**: A local search algorithm that removes and reconnects three edges in routes to find better solutions.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **High-quality refinement**: Best used as a post-processing step to improve an existing solution.
  - **Complex networks**: Suitable for instances with intricate route structures requiring significant adjustment.
  - **Small to medium problem size**: Computationally expensive, so works best for smaller networks.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Problem size: Small to medium problems (e.g., <100 nodes).
  - Initial solution quality: Effective when initial solutions have room for improvement (e.g., >10% suboptimal).

---

### **6. `two_opt_0554()`**
- **Introduction**: A simpler local search algorithm that removes and reconnects two edges in a route to improve compactness.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Compactness improvement**: Best when routes need to be shortened or made more direct.
  - **Low problem complexity**: Suitable for less complex problems where computational simplicity is valued.
  - **As a subroutine**: Can be embedded in other heuristics for periodic improvement.
- **Quantifiable Factors**:
  - Problem size: Small to medium problems (e.g., <100 nodes).
  - Route compactness: Effective when initial routes are not compact (e.g., >10% suboptimal).

---

Before this discuss, we have already 17 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given that we are in the initial stage of solution construction with all vehicles starting at the depot and a large number of unvisited nodes (79), the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is well-suited. It excels in sparse networks and ensures good capacity utilization, which aligns with the current state where the node-to-vehicle ratio is 8.0 and vehicle capacity utilization is 0.942. Running it for 10 steps will help construct a foundational solution while balancing efficiency and solution quality.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 243.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 151
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: At this stage, we have a partially constructed solution with 69 unvisited nodes remaining. Since the node-to-vehicle ratio is relatively high (8.0), and we are still in the construction phase, it is beneficial to use the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic. This heuristic is suitable for small to medium-sized remaining nodes and can prioritize nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities. Additionally, its periodic 2-opt improvement will help maintain route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while balancing compactness and demand fulfillment.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 8
Delta of Current Cost: 137.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 73
---Round 2---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: At this stage, the solution is partially constructed with 61 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles still unused. The `saving_algorithm_710e` is ideal for consolidating routes by merging them based on savings calculations, especially since vehicle capacity utilization is high (0.942), and the node-to-vehicle ratio remains significant (8.0). Running it for 6 steps will help consolidate and optimize the existing routes while accommodating more unvisited nodes. The small merge threshold ensures that capacity constraints are respected during this stage.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: At this stage, the solution has been partially constructed, with 61 unvisited nodes and a relatively high vehicle capacity utilization (0.942). The current solution features some compact routes, but there is room for improvement in terms of route efficiency. Using the `two_opt_0554` heuristic will help refine the existing routes by reducing unnecessary detours and improving compactness. Running it for 6 steps will allow for a targeted refinement of the solution, while still keeping the focus on optimizing the current partial routes. Once compactness is improved, we can evaluate whether to continue with improvement or switch back to construction heuristics.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -25.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: The previous application of `two_opt_0554` successfully reduced the total cost (-25.0) but did not improve the number of visited nodes or fulfilled demands. This indicates that while route compactness was enhanced, further refinement is needed to unlock additional improvement opportunities. As `three_opt_e8d7` is a more powerful refinement heuristic, it is logical to switch to this for deeper route optimization. Running it for 6 steps will allow for significant improvement in route efficiency, particularly given the relatively small number of routes and remaining unvisited nodes (61). This heuristic is well-suited for this stage of the solution, focusing on refining existing routes.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: Considering that there are still 61 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, it's important to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to ensure route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will help incrementally build the solution while maintaining an efficient structure for future refinements.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 8
Delta of Current Cost: 165.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 74
---Round 6---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: Currently, there are still 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, indicating that further route consolidation and optimization are necessary. The `saving_algorithm_710e` heuristic is ideal for this stage because it can merge existing routes based on savings, effectively utilizing the remaining vehicle capacities while respecting constraints. Consolidating routes now will create a stronger foundation for further construction or refinement, ensuring better efficiency as we proceed. Running it for 6 steps will balance optimization and preparation for future construction.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 7---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: At this stage, there are still 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes. It's important to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable because it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to maintain compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while preparing for further refinements.

---Round 8---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: The current solution has 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, indicating that construction is ongoing but also needs refinement. Since `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been used multiple times recently to construct routes, it is a good time to switch to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554`. This will help improve route compactness and reduce the current cost before proceeding with further construction. Running it for 6 steps allows for targeted optimization without overcommitting, especially as we prepare for the next phase of construction.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: Considering the current state, there are still 45 unvisited nodes and 6 vehicles with no routes. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities, ensuring continued solution construction. Additionally, its periodic 2-opt improvement will help maintain route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while preparing for further refinements.

Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: Currently, there are still 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. The solution has been partially constructed, and while `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been effective in building the solution incrementally, it is important to consolidate and optimize the existing routes before proceeding further. The `saving_algorithm_710e` is ideal for this stage to merge routes based on savings calculations, improving route efficiency and utilizing the remaining vehicle capacities effectively. Running it for 6 steps with a small merge threshold will ensure capacity constraints are respected while preparing for further construction or refinement.

Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: At the current stage, there are still 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. The solution is progressing incrementally, and it is crucial to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable because it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to maintain compactness. Running it for 8 steps will balance construction and route efficiency while preparing for subsequent refinements.

Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: The current state shows a partially constructed solution with 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. While `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been effective in incrementally constructing the solution, route compactness and efficiency should be prioritized before further construction. The `two_opt_0554` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it focuses on reducing unnecessary detours and improving route compactness. Running it for 6 steps allows for targeted refinement of the existing solution, ensuring a more efficient foundation for further construction or optimization.

Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: Based on the current state, there are still 29 unvisited nodes and 4 vehicles with no routes. The `saving_algorithm_710e` heuristic is ideal at this stage for consolidating routes and optimizing the solution further. Consolidation can help reduce the number of unused vehicles and prepare the solution for further construction or refinement. A slightly higher merge threshold (0.1) will allow more flexible route merging while respecting capacity constraints. Running it for 6 steps ensures focused optimization.

Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 6
Explain: The current state indicates that 21 nodes are still unvisited, and 2 vehicles remain completely unused. While the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective for incremental node construction, it is a good time to consolidate and optimize the existing routes. The `saving_algorithm_710e` is well-suited for this stage, as it can merge routes based on savings calculations, improving overall efficiency and creating a stronger foundation for further construction or refinement. A slightly higher merge threshold (0.1) allows for more flexible merging while respecting capacity constraints.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 8
Explain: At this stage, there are still 21 unvisited nodes and 2 vehicles with no routes. Since the remaining nodes are relatively small and the `saving_algorithm_710e` heuristic has been used recently without improving the solution, it is logical to switch back to a construction heuristic like `nearest_neighbor_54a9`. This heuristic is well-suited for incrementally addressing unvisited nodes while maintaining compact routes through its periodic 2-opt improvements. Running it for 8 steps will help further construct the solution and prepare for subsequent refinements.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: two_opt_0554
running steps: 6
explanation: At this stage, there are only 13 unvisited nodes remaining, and the remaining vehicles have low utilization (2 vehicles unused). The previous application of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has successfully reduced the number of unvisited nodes but increased the total cost (+113.0). To refine the current solution and reduce unnecessary detours, it is prudent to switch to the `two_opt_0554` heuristic. This heuristic is well-suited for improving route compactness and reducing costs in partially constructed solutions. Running it for 6 steps ensures targeted refinement without overcommitting, preparing the solution for further incremental construction if needed.
