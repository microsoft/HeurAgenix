Below is an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios where they are most effective, along with quantifiable factors to determine their applicability:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `farthest_insertion_6308()`**\n- **Introduction**: This heuristic focuses on selecting unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It also includes greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **Sparse networks**: Where nodes are widely spread, and the farthest insertion can help minimize long connections in the route.\n  - **High vehicle utilization**: When compactness and capacity management are critical, such as when total demand is close to the total vehicle capacity.\n  - **Large problem size**: Suitable for larger instances where local improvements like swaps can make a significant difference.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Node density: Low node density (distance between nodes is high).\n  - Demand-to-capacity ratio: High ratio (e.g., total demand is close to total vehicle capacity).\n  - Number of nodes: Suitable for larger node sets (e.g., >50 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **2. `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()`**\n- **Introduction**: Optimized for performance, this heuristic seeks to minimize insertion costs and uses efficient logic to enhance the solution.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **High-density networks**: Where nodes are closer to each other, making insertion cost minimization highly effective.\n  - **Tight deadlines**: When computational efficiency is important due to time constraints.\n  - **Low complexity required**: Suitable as an initial heuristic to generate a feasible solution quickly for further refinement.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Node density: High node density (short average distance between nodes).\n  - Problem size: Medium-sized problems (e.g., 20-100 nodes) where computational efficiency is important.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `nearest_neighbor_54a9()`**\n- **Introduction**: Prioritizes nodes with higher demands and applies a 2-opt heuristic for compactness.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **Small to medium problem size**: Performs well in small to moderately sized instances where greedy selection is feasible.\n  - **High demand variance**: When nodes have varying demands, and prioritizing higher-demand nodes improves capacity usage.\n  - **Compact networks**: Suitable for networks where nodes are relatively close, and compact routes are desired.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Number of nodes: Small to medium instances (e.g., <50 nodes).\n  - Demand variance: High variance in demand across nodes.\n  - Node density: High or medium density.\n\n---\n\n### **4. `saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold=0.0)`**\n- **Introduction**: Merges routes based on savings, considering capacity constraints.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **High vehicle count**: Effective in reducing the number of routes when vehicles are underutilized.\n  - **Homogeneous demand**: Works well when demand per node is relatively uniform, as merging routes becomes simpler to manage.\n  - **Flexible thresholds**: The merge threshold can be adjusted for different problem complexities.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Vehicle utilization: Low utilization (e.g., vehicles are operating far below capacity).\n  - Demand uniformity: Low variance in demand across nodes.\n  - Merge threshold: A higher threshold can reduce aggressive merging for tighter constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **5. `three_opt_e8d7()`**\n- **Introduction**: A local search algorithm that removes and reconnects three edges in routes to find better solutions.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **High-quality refinement**: Best used as a post-processing step to improve an existing solution.\n  - **Complex networks**: Suitable for instances with intricate route structures requiring significant adjustment.\n  - **Small to medium problem size**: Computationally expensive, so works best for smaller networks.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Problem size: Small to medium problems (e.g., <100 nodes).\n  - Initial solution quality: Effective when initial solutions have room for improvement (e.g., >10% suboptimal).\n\n---\n\n### **6. `two_opt_0554()`**\n- **Introduction**: A simpler local search algorithm that removes and reconnects two edges in a route to improve compactness.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - **Compactness improvement**: Best when routes need to be shortened or made more direct.\n  - **Low problem complexity**: Suitable for less complex problems where computational simplicity is valued.\n  - **As a subroutine**: Can be embedded in other heuristics for periodic improvement.\n- **Quantifiable Factors**:\n  - Problem size: Small to medium problems (e.g., <100 nodes).\n  - Route compactness: Effective when initial routes are not compact (e.g., >10% suboptimal).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Applicability**\n| **Heuristic**          | **Best Scenarios**                                                              | **Key Factors**                              |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308()` | Sparse networks, high vehicle utilization, large problem size                  | Low node density, high demand-to-capacity ratio |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()` | High-density networks, tight deadlines, low complexity required               | High node density, medium problem size       |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9()`   | Small to medium problems, high demand variance, compact networks              | High demand variance, high node density      |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e()`   | High vehicle count, homogeneous demand, flexible constraints                  | Low vehicle utilization, low demand variance |\n| `three_opt_e8d7()`          | High-quality refinement, complex networks, small to medium problem size       | Small problem size, suboptimal initial solution |\n| `two_opt_0554()`            | Compactness improvement, low problem complexity, subroutine use               | Small problem size, suboptimal compactness   |\n\n---\n\n### **General Recommendations**\n- **Initial Solution Generation**: Use `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()` or `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` for quick and feasible initial solutions.\n- **Refinement**: Apply `three_opt_e8d7()` or `two_opt_0554()` to refine solutions post-initialization.\n- **Route Consolidation**: Use `saving_algorithm_710e()` to minimize the number of routes, especially when vehicle utilization is low.\n- **Large Problems**: For larger instances, consider `farthest_insertion_6308()` for better scalability and capacity management."

It excels in sparse networks and ensures good capacity utilization, which aligns with the current state where the node-to-vehicle ratio is 8.0 and vehicle capacity utilization is 0.942. Running it for 10 steps will help construct a foundational solution while balancing efficiency and solution quality.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 243.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 151\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 8\nExplain: At this stage, we have a partially constructed solution with 69 unvisited nodes remaining. Since the node-to-vehicle ratio is relatively high (8.0), and we are still in the construction phase, it is beneficial to use the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic. This heuristic is suitable for small to medium-sized remaining nodes and can prioritize nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities. Additionally, its periodic 2-opt improvement will help maintain route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while balancing compactness and demand fulfillment.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 8\nDelta of Current Cost: 137.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 73\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: At this stage, the solution is partially constructed with 61 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles still unused. The `saving_algorithm_710e` is ideal for consolidating routes by merging them based on savings calculations, especially since vehicle capacity utilization is high (0.942), and the node-to-vehicle ratio remains significant (8.0). Running it for 6 steps will help consolidate and optimize the existing routes while accommodating more unvisited nodes. The small merge threshold ensures that capacity constraints are respected during this stage.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: At this stage, the solution has been partially constructed, with 61 unvisited nodes and a relatively high vehicle capacity utilization (0.942). The current solution features some compact routes, but there is room for improvement in terms of route efficiency. Using the `two_opt_0554` heuristic will help refine the existing routes by reducing unnecessary detours and improving compactness. Running it for 6 steps will allow for a targeted refinement of the solution, while still keeping the focus on optimizing the current partial routes. Once compactness is improved, we can evaluate whether to continue with improvement or switch back to construction heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -25.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: The previous application of `two_opt_0554` successfully reduced the total cost (-25.0) but did not improve the number of visited nodes or fulfilled demands. This indicates that while route compactness was enhanced, further refinement is needed to unlock additional improvement opportunities. As `three_opt_e8d7` is a more powerful refinement heuristic, it is logical to switch to this for deeper route optimization. Running it for 6 steps will allow for significant improvement in route efficiency, particularly given the relatively small number of routes and remaining unvisited nodes (61). This heuristic is well-suited for this stage of the solution, focusing on refining existing routes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 8\nExplain: Considering that there are still 61 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, it's important to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to ensure route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will help incrementally build the solution while maintaining an efficient structure for future refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 8\nDelta of Current Cost: 165.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 74\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: Currently, there are still 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, indicating that further route consolidation and optimization are necessary. The `saving_algorithm_710e` heuristic is ideal for this stage because it can merge existing routes based on savings, effectively utilizing the remaining vehicle capacities while respecting constraints. Consolidating routes now will create a stronger foundation for further construction or refinement, ensuring better efficiency as we proceed. Running it for 6 steps will balance optimization and preparation for future construction.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 8\nExplain: At this stage, there are still 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes. It's important to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable because it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to maintain compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while preparing for further refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 8\nDelta of Current Cost: 213.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 92\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: The current solution has 53 unvisited nodes and 7 vehicles with no routes, indicating that construction is ongoing but also needs refinement. Since `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been used multiple times recently to construct routes, it is a good time to switch to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554`. This will help improve route compactness and reduce the current cost before proceeding with further construction. Running it for 6 steps allows for targeted optimization without overcommitting, especially as we prepare for the next phase of construction.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -21.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 8\nExplain: Considering the current state, there are still 45 unvisited nodes and 6 vehicles with no routes. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities, ensuring continued solution construction. Additionally, its periodic 2-opt improvement will help maintain route compactness. Running it for 8 steps will incrementally build the solution while preparing for further refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 8\nDelta of Current Cost: 191.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 90\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: Currently, there are still 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. The solution has been partially constructed, and while `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been effective in building the solution incrementally, it is important to consolidate and optimize the existing routes before proceeding further. The `saving_algorithm_710e` is ideal for this stage to merge routes based on savings calculations, improving route efficiency and utilizing the remaining vehicle capacities effectively. Running it for 6 steps with a small merge threshold will ensure capacity constraints are respected while preparing for further construction or refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 8\nExplain: At the current stage, there are still 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. The solution is progressing incrementally, and it is crucial to continue constructing the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is suitable because it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the remaining vehicle capacities and applies periodic 2-opt improvements to maintain compactness. Running it for 8 steps will balance construction and route efficiency while preparing for subsequent refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 8\nDelta of Current Cost: 192.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 117\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 6\nExplain: The current state shows a partially constructed solution with 37 unvisited nodes and 5 vehicles with no routes. While `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has been effective in incrementally constructing the solution, route compactness and efficiency should be prioritized before further construction. The `two_opt_0554` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it focuses on reducing unnecessary detours and improving route compactness.

How does two_opt_0554 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
