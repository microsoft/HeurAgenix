                "text": "The heuristics you have implemented are diverse and cater to different aspects of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Each heuristic has scenarios where it performs better based on the nature of the problem instance, such as problem size, demand distribution, capacity constraints, and node clustering. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable and quantifiable factors that can help determine the best fit:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **farthest_insertion_6308**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for instances with **geographically spread-out nodes** or when the depot is far from clusters of nodes.\n   - Works well when **balancing vehicle utilization** and route compactness is critical.\n   - Performs better in **medium to large instances** due to the scoring mechanism's ability to handle many potential insertions.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: High standard deviation in node locations (spread-out nodes).  \n   - **Demand Uniformity**: Works best when demands are moderately uniform.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **min_cost_insertion_3b2b**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Effective in instances where **cost minimization** (e.g., distance or time) is the primary goal.  \n   - Performs well in cases with **tight capacity constraints** or when vehicle utilization is critical.  \n   - Suitable for **dense node distributions** where many nodes are close together.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Distance Matrix Density**: High density in the distance matrix (e.g., many low-distance edges).  \n   - **Capacity Constraints**: Instances with small vehicle capacities relative to demands.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 50).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **nearest_neighbor_54a9**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for instances where nodes are **clustered geographically** and demand is **non-uniform**.  \n   - Performs well in **small to medium instances** where the simplicity of nearest-neighbor logic is computationally advantageous.  \n   - Effective when **demand prioritization** is crucial, especially for high-demand nodes.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Node Clustering**: High clustering coefficient in the graph of node locations.  \n   - **Demand Variance**: High variance in demand values.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 100).  \n   - **Unvisited Nodes**: Performs better as the number of unvisited nodes decreases.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **saving_algorithm_710e**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Ideal for instances where **merging routes** can significantly reduce total cost.  \n   - Effective when nodes are **moderately spread out** but still have overlapping savings potential.  \n   - Suitable for **medium to large instances** where the number of routes can be reduced significantly.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Merge Savings Potential**: High average potential savings from merging routes (e.g., based on the distance matrix).  \n   - **Capacity Constraints**: Moderate capacity constraints.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).  \n   - **Merge Threshold**: Configurable parameter that can influence performance in specific scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **three_opt_e8d7**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Useful for **fine-tuning and improving existing solutions** by removing suboptimal loops.  \n   - Best applied when a **good initial solution is already available** (e.g., from another heuristic).  \n   - Works well in **medium to large instances** where local optimizations can significantly reduce costs.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Initial Solution Quality**: Can be measured by the total cost of the initial solution.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).  \n   - **Route Length**: Effective when average route lengths are high.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **two_opt_0554**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for **simpler local optimization** tasks or as a **pre-step to more complex optimizations**.  \n   - Performs well in **small to medium instances** or when route compactness is critical.  \n   - Effective when the solution has **many unnecessary crossings** in routes.\n   \n   **Quantifiable Factors**:  \n   - **Route Crossings**: High number of crossings in initial routes.  \n   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 100).  \n   - **Cost Reduction Potential**: Effective when the cost gap between the current and optimal solution is high.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Heuristic Applicability Based on Quantifiable Factors:\n\n| Heuristic                  | Best for Problem Size | Key Factors (Quantifiable)                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| farthest_insertion_6308    | Medium to Large       | Node distribution (spread-out), demand uniformity, instance size (node_num > 50).          |\n| min_cost_insertion_3b2b    | Small to Medium       | Distance matrix density, tight capacity constraints, instance size (node_num <= 50).       |\n| nearest_neighbor_54a9      | Small to Medium       | Node clustering, demand variance, unvisited nodes, instance size (node_num <= 100).        |\n| saving_algorithm_710e      | Medium to Large       | Merge savings potential, capacity constraints, merge threshold, instance size (node_num > 50). |\n| three_opt_e8d7             | Medium to Large       | Initial solution quality, route length, instance size (node_num > 50).                     |\n| two_opt_0554               | Small to Medium       | Route crossings, instance size (node_num <= 100), cost reduction potential.                |\n\n---\n\n### General Guidelines for Algorithm Selection:\n1. **Start with Construction Heuristics**:\n   - Use `farthest_insertion_6308`, `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`, or `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to create an initial solution.\n   - Select based on factors like node distribution, demand uniformity, and clustering.\n\n2. **Refine with Improvement Heuristics**:\n   - Use `saving_algorithm_710e`, `three_opt_e8d7`, or `two_opt_0554` to improve the initial solution.\n   - Choose based on factors like cost reduction potential, route crossings, and merge savings.\n\n3. **Iterate Using Hyper-Heuristics**:\n   - Combine multiple heuristics adaptively using hyper-heuristic frameworks to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\n"
