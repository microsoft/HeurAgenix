I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP) and can be effectively addressed using heuristic and hyper-heuristic methods. The framework you described, including the `Solution` representation, operators, and heuristic function signature, appears valid and well-structured for solving CVRP. The use of operators to iteratively modify and improve solutions aligns with how heuristics and metaheuristics are typically applied in combinatorial problems.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

The heuristics you have implemented are diverse and cater to different aspects of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Each heuristic has scenarios where it performs better based on the nature of the problem instance, such as problem size, demand distribution, capacity constraints, and node clustering. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable and quantifiable factors that can help determine the best fit:

---

### 1. **farthest_insertion_6308**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Best for instances with **geographically spread-out nodes** or when the depot is far from clusters of nodes.
   - Works well when **balancing vehicle utilization** and route compactness is critical.
   - Performs better in **medium to large instances** due to the scoring mechanism's ability to handle many potential insertions.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Node Distribution**: High standard deviation in node locations (spread-out nodes).  
   - **Demand Uniformity**: Works best when demands are moderately uniform.  
   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).

---

### 2. **min_cost_insertion_3b2b**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Effective in instances where **cost minimization** (e.g., distance or time) is the primary goal.  
   - Performs well in cases with **tight capacity constraints** or when vehicle utilization is critical.  
   - Suitable for **dense node distributions** where many nodes are close together.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Distance Matrix Density**: High density in the distance matrix (e.g., many low-distance edges).  
   - **Capacity Constraints**: Instances with small vehicle capacities relative to demands.  
   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 50).

---

### 3. **nearest_neighbor_54a9**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Best for instances where nodes are **clustered geographically** and demand is **non-uniform**.  
   - Performs well in **small to medium instances** where the simplicity of nearest-neighbor logic is computationally advantageous.  
   - Effective when **demand prioritization** is crucial, especially for high-demand nodes.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Node Clustering**: High clustering coefficient in the graph of node locations.  
   - **Demand Variance**: High variance in demand values.  
   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 100).  
   - **Unvisited Nodes**: Performs better as the number of unvisited nodes decreases.

---

### 4. **saving_algorithm_710e**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Ideal for instances where **merging routes** can significantly reduce total cost.  
   - Effective when nodes are **moderately spread out** but still have overlapping savings potential.  
   - Suitable for **medium to large instances** where the number of routes can be reduced significantly.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Merge Savings Potential**: High average potential savings from merging routes (e.g., based on the distance matrix).  
   - **Capacity Constraints**: Moderate capacity constraints.  
   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).  
   - **Merge Threshold**: Configurable parameter that can influence performance in specific scenarios.

---

### 5. **three_opt_e8d7**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Useful for **fine-tuning and improving existing solutions** by removing suboptimal loops.  
   - Best applied when a **good initial solution is already available** (e.g., from another heuristic).  
   - Works well in **medium to large instances** where local optimizations can significantly reduce costs.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Initial Solution Quality**: Can be measured by the total cost of the initial solution.  
   - **Problem Size**: Medium to large instances (e.g., node_num > 50).  
   - **Route Length**: Effective when average route lengths are high.

---

### 6. **two_opt_0554**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Suitable for **simpler local optimization** tasks or as a **pre-step to more complex optimizations**.  
   - Performs well in **small to medium instances** or when route compactness is critical.  
   - Effective when the solution has **many unnecessary crossings** in routes.
   
   **Quantifiable Factors**:  
   - **Route Crossings**: High number of crossings in initial routes.  
   - **Problem Size**: Small to medium instances (e.g., node_num <= 100).  
   - **Cost Reduction Potential**: Effective when the cost gap between the current and optimal solution is high.

---

### General Guidelines for Algorithm Selection:
1. **Start with Construction Heuristics**:
   - Use `farthest_insertion_6308`, `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`, or `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to create an initial solution.
   - Select based on factors like node distribution, demand uniformity, and clustering.

2. **Refine with Improvement Heuristics**:
   - Use `saving_algorithm_710e`, `three_opt_e8d7`, or `two_opt_0554` to improve the initial solution.
   - Choose based on factors like cost reduction potential, route crossings, and merge savings.

3. **Iterate Using Hyper-Heuristics**:
   - Combine multiple heuristics adaptively using hyper-heuristic frameworks to balance exploration and exploitation.
