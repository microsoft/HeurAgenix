The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

Given the average distance between nodes is moderate, and the demands are relatively evenly distributed (low variance), the greedy heuristic is a suitable choice to quickly construct an initial feasible solution by adding the closest unvisited nodes to the routes.

The farthest_insertion_ce2b heuristic is well-suited here to prioritize distant unvisited nodes, thereby addressing the unvisited backlog while constructing routes that may reduce future costs. This is especially relevant given the moderately high average distance (51.73) and distance variance (610.12). Running 15 steps allows more progress while keeping computational costs manageable.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 473.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 145\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: Given the current state, with several unvisited nodes (54), high remaining vehicle capacity for unused vehicles, and the opportunity to merge routes efficiently, the Saving Algorithm is a logical next step. It prioritizes merging routes to reduce total cost while considering vehicle capacity constraints. Running 20 steps will allow significant progress in addressing the unvisited nodes and improving route utilization. The merge threshold is set to 0.1 to balance savings and computational feasibility.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state shows that 54 nodes remain unvisited, and there is significant remaining vehicle capacity. The nearest_neighbor_99ba heuristic is suitable at this stage because it prioritizes adding the closest unvisited node to the routes, which can help efficiently utilize the remaining vehicle capacities while minimizing incremental costs. This heuristic complements the previous savings-based approach by focusing on filling the gaps in the solution with minimal distance additions. Running 15 steps allows for measurable progress in addressing the unvisited nodes while keeping computational costs reasonable.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 357.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 139\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state, with 39 unvisited nodes and a significant imbalance in vehicle utilization (5 vehicles are completely unused and the remaining have varying capacities), the `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` heuristic is a logical choice. This heuristic aims to rebalance load across vehicles by shifting nodes between routes, potentially freeing capacity in overloaded vehicles while improving the distribution of demand. Running 10 steps allows a targeted refinement of the solution without excessive computational effort.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -197.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state shows significant imbalance in route lengths (std_dev_route_length = 4.88) and a relatively high current cost (946.0). The two_opt_0554 heuristic is suitable for refining the solution by optimizing individual routes to eliminate crossing edges and reduce the total route cost. This can improve route efficiency and potentially free capacity for further node allocation.

While the two_opt_0554 heuristic has made marginal improvements, the high standard deviation in route lengths (4.88) and the number of unvisited nodes (39) indicate potential for further optimization. The variable_neighborhood_search_614b heuristic is well-suited for escaping local optima by systematically exploring multiple neighborhood structures. This allows for a broader search space and increases the likelihood of improving route efficiency and addressing unvisited nodes.

The remaining vehicle capacities are sufficient to accommodate the unvisited nodes. Additionally, the average distance between nodes is moderate (51.73), making the nearest_neighbor_99ba heuristic a good choice to efficiently allocate the unvisited nodes to the routes while minimizing incremental costs.

Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nTry different heuristics for better result.\n\nThe response format is very important.
