I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Before this discuss, we have already 10 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state indicates no nodes have been visited yet, and all vehicles are idle with maximum capacity. Given the average distance between nodes is moderate, and the demands are relatively evenly distributed (low variance), the greedy heuristic is a suitable choice to quickly construct an initial feasible solution by adding the closest unvisited nodes to the routes. This approach is computationally efficient and ensures rapid progress in the early stages of the solution construction.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 313.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 127
---Round 1---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current state shows that vehicle utilization is imbalanced (only two vehicles are partially used), and 69 nodes remain unvisited. The farthest_insertion_ce2b heuristic is well-suited here to prioritize distant unvisited nodes, thereby addressing the unvisited backlog while constructing routes that may reduce future costs. This is especially relevant given the moderately high average distance (51.73) and distance variance (610.12). Running 15 steps allows more progress while keeping computational costs manageable.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 473.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 145
---Round 2---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: Given the current state, with several unvisited nodes (54), high remaining vehicle capacity for unused vehicles, and the opportunity to merge routes efficiently, the Saving Algorithm is a logical next step. It prioritizes merging routes to reduce total cost while considering vehicle capacity constraints. Running 20 steps will allow significant progress in addressing the unvisited nodes and improving route utilization. The merge threshold is set to 0.1 to balance savings and computational feasibility.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current state shows that 54 nodes remain unvisited, and there is significant remaining vehicle capacity. The nearest_neighbor_99ba heuristic is suitable at this stage because it prioritizes adding the closest unvisited node to the routes, which can help efficiently utilize the remaining vehicle capacities while minimizing incremental costs. This heuristic complements the previous savings-based approach by focusing on filling the gaps in the solution with minimal distance additions. Running 15 steps allows for measurable progress in addressing the unvisited nodes while keeping computational costs reasonable.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 357.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 139
---Round 4---
Heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state, with 39 unvisited nodes and a significant imbalance in vehicle utilization (5 vehicles are completely unused and the remaining have varying capacities), the `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` heuristic is a logical choice. This heuristic aims to rebalance load across vehicles by shifting nodes between routes, potentially freeing capacity in overloaded vehicles while improving the distribution of demand. Running 10 steps allows a targeted refinement of the solution without excessive computational effort.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -197.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current state shows significant imbalance in route lengths (std_dev_route_length = 4.88) and a relatively high current cost (946.0). The two_opt_0554 heuristic is suitable for refining the solution by optimizing individual routes to eliminate crossing edges and reduce the total route cost. This can improve route efficiency and potentially free capacity for further node allocation. Running 15 steps allows for targeted refinement without excessive computational cost.

Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The current solution shows a significant imbalance in route utilization (5 vehicles unused) and a relatively high total cost (940.0). While the two_opt_0554 heuristic has made marginal improvements, the high standard deviation in route lengths (4.88) and the number of unvisited nodes (39) indicate potential for further optimization. The variable_neighborhood_search_614b heuristic is well-suited for escaping local optima by systematically exploring multiple neighborhood structures. This allows for a broader search space and increases the likelihood of improving route efficiency and addressing unvisited nodes. Running 20 steps balances computational cost with the potential for meaningful progress.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 20
Delta of Current Cost: 445.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 274
---Round 7---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current state shows 19 unvisited nodes, with unvisited nodes having an average demand of 13.53 and a total remaining demand of 257. The remaining vehicle capacities are sufficient to accommodate the unvisited nodes. Additionally, the average distance between nodes is moderate (51.73), making the nearest_neighbor_99ba heuristic a good choice to efficiently allocate the unvisited nodes to the routes while minimizing incremental costs. Running 15 steps will allow for measurable progress in addressing the unvisited nodes while keeping computational costs reasonable.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 422.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 193
---Round 8---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: There are only 4 unvisited nodes left with a total demand of 64. The min_cost_insertion_7bfa heuristic is suitable for efficiently inserting these nodes into the existing routes at the lowest incremental cost. Running 10 steps should be sufficient to allocate the remaining nodes while keeping computational costs manageable.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 4
Delta of Current Cost: 348.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 64
---Round 9---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has been constructed with all nodes visited, and the total cost is 2155.0. However, the standard deviation in route lengths (2.879) and the average route cost (107.1) suggest there is room for further optimization. The two_opt_0554 heuristic is a suitable choice for refining the solution by eliminating crossing edges and reducing route costs without altering the overall structure. Running 10 steps will allow for localized improvements without significant computational overhead.

Delta of Current Cost: -8.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: two_opt_0554. How does two_opt_0554 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Try different heuristics for better result.

explanation: The current solution is valid, with all nodes visited and a total cost of 2147.0. However, the standard deviation in route lengths (2.879) and the average route cost (107.3) suggest there is room for further optimization. The two_opt_0554 heuristic is suitable for refining the solution by eliminating crossing edges and reducing route costs.
