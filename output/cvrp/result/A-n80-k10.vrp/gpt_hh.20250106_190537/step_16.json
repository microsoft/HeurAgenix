The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity.

This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

Running it for four more steps should help incorporate these remaining nodes and optimize the current solution further. Given the proximity of these nodes and the available capacity in the vehicles, this approach is expected to efficiently finalize the current stage of the solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 4\nDelta of Current Cost: 200.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 46\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The 2-opt heuristic will perform local optimizations to eliminate route loops and reduce the total travel cost. With all nodes already visited, this heuristic is suitable for refining and optimizing the current solution without altering the basic route structure.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -170.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The 2-opt heuristic has shown a reduction in total cost in the previous round, indicating its effectiveness in refining the current solution by eliminating suboptimal loops. Given that all nodes are visited and the solution is valid, another round of 2-opt can further optimize the route structure and potentially reduce the total cost even more. Continuing with 10 more steps should provide sufficient opportunity to explore further improvements without drastic changes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -25.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 14---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Given the effectiveness of the 2-opt heuristic in reducing the total cost in previous rounds, running it for 5 more steps could potentially yield additional cost reductions by further refining the route structure. This will help determine if more optimization is possible or if the solution is approaching a local optimum.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 15---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic will explore different neighborhood structures to potentially escape any local optima and identify further improvements in the solution. Given that all nodes are visited and the solution is valid, VNS can provide a final refinement to the current solution by systematically exploring alternative neighborhood configurations. Running for 5 steps should provide insight into any additional optimization opportunities.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: variable_neighborhood_search_614b. How does variable_neighborhood_search_614b perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
