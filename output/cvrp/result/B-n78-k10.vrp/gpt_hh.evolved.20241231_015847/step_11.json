Below is an analysis of scenarios where each algorithm is most applicable, as well as quantifiable metrics or criteria to identify those scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Suitable for instances where a balanced solution is required, considering both cost and capacity constraints.\n     - Effective for instances with a sparse or uneven distribution of nodes, where insertion order and compactness are critical for efficiency.\n     - Works well when routes need to be compact while maximizing vehicle capacity utilization.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - High variance in the distance matrix (i.e., some nodes are far from others).\n     - High variance in customer demands (some customers require significantly more goods than others).\n     - Relatively low computational time budget, as this heuristic is faster than some of the more exhaustive approaches.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Best for instances where minimizing the incremental cost of inserting nodes is critical, such as when cost efficiency is prioritized over speed.\n     - Suitable for dense problem instances where nodes are relatively clustered, and small incremental costs can lead to efficient solutions.\n     - Effective when computational resources are limited but high-quality solutions are desired.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - Low to moderate variance in the distance matrix (densely connected nodes).\n     - Moderate variance in customer demands.\n     - Small to medium-sized problem instances (e.g., fewer than 100 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Applicable for instances where a quick, approximate solution is acceptable, especially in the presence of tight time constraints.\n     - Useful as a constructive heuristic for generating an initial solution that can be refined using improvement heuristics like 2-opt or 3-opt.\n     - Performs well in instances where nodes are relatively evenly distributed and demands are relatively uniform.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - Low variance in the distance matrix (i.e., distances between nodes are relatively uniform).\n     - Low variance in customer demands.\n     - Large problem instances (e.g., 100+ nodes) where a fast initial solution is required.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Ideal for instances where merging routes can significantly reduce the overall cost.\n     - Performs well when there are opportunities for consolidation (e.g., many small routes can be merged into fewer, longer routes).\n     - Best suited for instances with a relatively even distribution of nodes and demands, where savings calculations are straightforward and effective.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - Moderate to high variance in the distance matrix (opportunities for significant savings through route consolidation).\n     - Moderate variance in customer demands.\n     - Number of vehicles is limited, and capacity utilization needs to be maximized.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Best for fine-tuning solutions in instances where a high-quality, compact solution is required.\n     - Suitable for dense problem instances where small adjustments to routes can lead to significant cost reductions.\n     - Effective for small to medium-sized instances due to the higher computational complexity of the 3-opt heuristic.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - Low variance in the distance matrix (dense clusters of nodes where local optimization can improve compactness).\n     - Moderate variance in customer demands.\n     - Small to medium-sized problem instances (e.g., fewer than 100 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - Applicable for improving existing solutions by reducing route costs through edge swaps.\n     - Suitable for instances where compact, short routes are desired, and the initial solution is already reasonably close to optimal.\n     - Effective for both small and large problem instances due to its relatively low computational complexity compared to 3-opt.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - Low variance in the distance matrix (dense clusters of nodes where small adjustments can improve compactness).\n     - Low to moderate variance in customer demands.\n     - Both small and large problem instances (scalable due to lower complexity).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Quantifiable Metrics:\nFor each heuristic, the following metrics can be used to determine applicability:\n1. **Distance Matrix Variance**: Measures the spread of distances between nodes.\n   - High variance: `farthest_insertion_6308`, `saving_algorithm_710e`.\n   - Low variance: `nearest_neighbor_54a9`, `two_opt_0554`, `three_opt_e8d7`.\n\n2. **Demand Variance**: Measures how uniform or varied the demands of customers are.\n   - High variance: `farthest_insertion_6308`.\n   - Moderate variance: `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`, `saving_algorithm_710e`.\n   - Low variance: `nearest_neighbor_54a9`, `two_opt_0554`.\n\n3. **Problem Size** (Number of nodes):\n   - Small (e.g., < 50 nodes): `three_opt_e8d7`, `two_opt_0554`.\n   - Medium (e.g., 50\u2013100 nodes): `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`, `farthest_insertion_6308`.\n   - Large (e.g., > 100 nodes): `nearest_neighbor_54a9`.\n\n4. **Computational Time Budget**:\n   - Low: `nearest_neighbor_54a9`, `saving_algorithm_710e`.\n   - Moderate: `farthest_insertion_6308`, `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`.\n   - High: `three_opt_e8d7`, `two_opt_0554`.\n\nBy analyzing these metrics for a given CVRP instance, you can select the most suitable heuristic or a combination of heuristics to achieve the desired balance between solution quality and computational efficiency."

This heuristic is computationally efficient and works well for large problem instances (node_num = 78). It will provide a quick and reasonable starting point for further improvement with more advanced heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 117.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 114\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has been partially constructed with `nearest_neighbor_54a9`, but the routes are not yet optimized. The `two_opt_0554` heuristic is computationally efficient and can quickly improve route compactness and reduce overall cost. Given the relatively small number of visited nodes (11) and the short route lengths, running `two_opt_0554` for 10 steps is a reasonable choice to test its impact on solution quality. If the improvement is insufficient, we can consider switching to the more advanced `three_opt_e8d7`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -1.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic showed only a marginal improvement in the solution quality (cost reduced by 1.0) after 10 steps, which indicates diminishing returns for further application. Given the current state of the solution, where routes are partially optimized but still have room for improvement, the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is a logical next step. This heuristic is more advanced and can explore a larger neighborhood to achieve better route compactness and cost reduction. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its impact and decide whether further refinement is needed.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has shown no improvement after being applied for 10 steps, suggesting that further application may yield diminishing returns. Given the current state of the solution, where a significant number of nodes (67) remain unvisited and vehicle routes are underutilized, it is crucial to constructively expand the solution. The `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic is a suitable choice for this stage as it effectively incorporates unvisited nodes while considering insertion costs, route compactness, and vehicle capacity. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to improve the solution's coverage and lay a foundation for future refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 58.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 124\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: +58). Given that 57 nodes remain unvisited and vehicle routes are still underutilized (7 vehicles have no assigned routes), continuing with `farthest_insertion_6308` for another 10 steps is a reasonable choice. This will help expand the solution coverage further while maintaining consideration for route compactness and capacity utilization. After this round, we can reassess whether to switch to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` to optimize the constructed routes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 110.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 151\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state of the solution has 47 unvisited nodes remaining, with 7 vehicles still unutilized. The `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic has shown good progress in the last two rounds, significantly increasing the number of visited nodes (+10 each round) and fulfilling substantial demands (+124 and +151). However, total cost has also increased (+58 and +110), which is expected at this stage due to expanding routes. Continuing with `farthest_insertion_6308` for another 10 steps is a logical choice to further construct the solution and reduce the unvisited node count while maintaining route compactness and capacity utilization. Once more nodes are visited, we can evaluate whether to switch to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 130.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 91\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds of `farthest_insertion_6308` have demonstrated consistent progress in reducing the number of unvisited nodes (+10 nodes per round) and fulfilling demands, which aligns well with the current state of the solution. Although the cost has increased, this is expected as new nodes are added. Given that there are still 37 unvisited nodes and several vehicles remain unused, continuing with `farthest_insertion_6308` for another 10 steps is a logical choice. This will further expand the solution and maintain route compactness and capacity utilization. After this round, we can reassess whether to transition to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` to optimize the constructed routes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 266.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 117\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows significant progress made by the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic in reducing unvisited nodes and fulfilling demands, albeit with an increase in total cost. With 27 unvisited nodes remaining and several vehicles still underutilized or unused, continuing with `farthest_insertion_6308` for another 10 steps is logical. This will further expand the solution while maintaining route compactness and capacity utilization. Once the unvisited node count drops further, we can evaluate transitioning to refinement heuristics like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` for optimizing the constructed routes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 252.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 133\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic has consistently demonstrated progress in reducing the number of unvisited nodes (+10 per round) while fulfilling demands effectively. Given the current state with 17 unvisited nodes remaining and some vehicles still underutilized or unused, it is logical to continue constructing the solution with `farthest_insertion_6308`. This will further expand the solution, maintaining route compactness and capacity utilization, and prepare the solution for refinement with advanced heuristics like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` once fewer unvisited nodes remain.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 245.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 99\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state indicates that there are still 7 unvisited nodes remaining, and vehicle 9 is entirely unused. The `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic has consistently performed well in previous rounds, reducing the number of unvisited nodes by 10 per round while fulfilling demands effectively. Continuing with `farthest_insertion_6308` for another 10 steps is logical to fully utilize the unused vehicle, further reduce unvisited nodes, and expand the solution. Once all nodes are visited, we can transition to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` for optimization.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 7\nDelta of Current Cost: 283.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 108\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has fully constructed routes with all nodes visited, and the `farthest_insertion_6308` heuristic has done a commendable job in achieving this. However, the total cost (1460.0) and route compactness can still be improved. Given the current state, the `two_opt_0554` heuristic is suitable for refining the solution by reducing route costs through edge swaps. Running it for 10 steps will help evaluate its impact on the solution quality. If improvements are marginal, we can consider transitioning to the more advanced `three_opt_e8d7` for further refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -26.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: two_opt_0554. How does two_opt_0554 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
