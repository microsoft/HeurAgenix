Useful when the solution is stuck in a local optimum.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Current Solution Quality:** If the current solution is near a local optimum.\n  - **Diversity in Routes:** Effective when there is a variety in route lengths and structures.\n  - **Iteration Count:** More iterations may be required for large problem instances.\n\n### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic**\n**Function:** `three_opt_e8d7`\n- **Scenario:** Similar to the two-opt but more powerful as it considers three edges. Best for refining solutions with potential complex interchanges.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Initial Solution Quality:** If the initial solution has a moderate to high total travel distance.\n  - **Average Distance:** Useful when average distances are moderate, providing more opportunities for improvement.\n  - **Standard Deviation of Distance:** Works well with moderate standard deviation.\n\n### 4. **Nearest Neighbor**\n**Function:** `nearest_neighbor_99ba`\n- **Scenario:** Simple and fast, best for constructing initial solutions. Good for problems with a dense node distribution near the depot.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Density:** High node density near the depot.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Uniform demand distribution.\n  - **Vehicle Capacity:** Moderate to high capacity, reducing the chance of route termination due to capacity constraints.\n\n### 5. **Greedy Heuristic**\n**Function:** `greedy_f4c4`\n- **Scenario:** Efficient for quickly generating a feasible solution. Suitable when time is a constraint.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Density:** High node density.\n  - **Distance Distribution:** Works better with a uniform distance distribution.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.\n\n### 6. **Saving Algorithm**\n**Function:** `saving_algorithm_710e`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for merging routes and reducing the number of routes. Best when initial routes are highly fragmented.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Fragmentation of Routes:** High fragmentation in initial routes.\n  - **Merge Threshold:** Determines the feasibility of merging routes.\n  - **Vehicle Capacity:** High capacity to allow for more merges.\n\n### 7. **Random Heuristic**\n**Function:** `random_bfdc`\n- **Scenario:** Useful for generating diverse initial solutions or as a baseline. Can be used to escape local optima by introducing randomness.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Solution Diversity:** High need for diverse solutions.\n  - **Iteration Count:** Used in combination with other heuristics for multiple iterations.\n\n### 8. **Petal Algorithm**\n**Function:** `petal_algorithm_b384`\n- **Scenario:** Good for creating routes around the depot, forming loops. Effective when nodes are clustered around the depot.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Clustering:** High clustering near the depot.\n  - **Route Lengths:** Creates routes of similar lengths.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.\n\n### 9. **Farthest Insertion**\n**Function:** `farthest_insertion_ce2b`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for ensuring distant nodes are considered early. Good for sparse distributions of nodes.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Distribution:** Sparse distribution of nodes.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.\n\n### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes**\n**Function:** `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`\n- **Scenario:** Useful for balancing loads and improving route efficiency. Best when routes are unbalanced.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Load Imbalance:** High imbalance in vehicle loads.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** Moderate to high variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** High demand variability.\n\n### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion**\n**Function:** `min_cost_insertion_7bfa`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for inserting nodes in a way that minimizes cost increases. Best for refining solutions.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Insertion Opportunities:** High number of insertion points.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.\n\nEach of these heuristics has its strengths and is best suited to certain problem characteristics. By analyzing the specific features of the CVRP instance (e.g., node density, distance distribution, demand variability), you can select the most appropriate heuristic or combination thereof to achieve an efficient solution."

This heuristic is efficient for building a feasible starting solution by considering the nearest unvisited nodes, which will help in creating a good base for further refinements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 29.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 94\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: We will use the Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic to explore multiple neighborhoods and improve the current solution. This heuristic will help in balancing the load across all vehicles and potentially reduce the total cost.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 190.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 199\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic will help balance the load across all vehicles by moving nodes between routes. This can reduce the total distance and improve the utilization of all vehicles. Given the current state, where some vehicles are fully loaded while others are empty, this heuristic is expected to make significant improvements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The greedy heuristic will help in constructing routes for the unused vehicles by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route. This will help in balancing the load and incorporating more nodes, thereby reducing the remaining demands.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 350.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 107\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Saving Algorithm will help in merging routes and reducing the total number of routes while considering vehicle capacity constraints.

How does node_shift_between_routes_7b8a perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

However, there may still be room for improvement, particularly in reducing the total cost or balancing the load more effectively across vehicles.\n\n### Assessment and Recommendation:\n\n1. **Current Situation**: \n   - All nodes have been visited, and all demands have been fulfilled.\n   - The last heuristic applied was `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`, which has been effective in balancing the load and reducing the total cost.\n\n2. **Potential for Improvement**:\n   - Since `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` has previously shown significant improvements, it may be beneficial to continue using it for a few more steps to see if further gains can be made.\n   - Alternatively, using a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` could help in reducing the total travel distance by optimizing the current routes.\n\nGiven the current state and historical performance, I recommend continuing with the `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` heuristic for a few more steps to balance the load further and potentially reduce the total cost. If the improvements are marginal, we can switch to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`.\n\n### Decision:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nrunning steps: 10\nexplanation: This heuristic has previously shown significant improvements in balancing the load and reducing the total cost.
