Useful when the solution is stuck in a local optimum.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Current Solution Quality:** If the current solution is near a local optimum.\n  - **Diversity in Routes:** Effective when there is a variety in route lengths and structures.\n  - **Iteration Count:** More iterations may be required for large problem instances.\n\n### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic**\n**Function:** `three_opt_e8d7`\n- **Scenario:** Similar to the two-opt but more powerful as it considers three edges. Best for refining solutions with potential complex interchanges.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Initial Solution Quality:** If the initial solution has a moderate to high total travel distance.\n  - **Average Distance:** Useful when average distances are moderate, providing more opportunities for improvement.\n  - **Standard Deviation of Distance:** Works well with moderate standard deviation.\n\n### 4. **Nearest Neighbor**\n**Function:** `nearest_neighbor_99ba`\n- **Scenario:** Simple and fast, best for constructing initial solutions. Good for problems with a dense node distribution near the depot.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Density:** High node density near the depot.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Uniform demand distribution.\n  - **Vehicle Capacity:** Moderate to high capacity, reducing the chance of route termination due to capacity constraints.\n\n### 5. **Greedy Heuristic**\n**Function:** `greedy_f4c4`\n- **Scenario:** Efficient for quickly generating a feasible solution. Suitable when time is a constraint.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Density:** High node density.\n  - **Distance Distribution:** Works better with a uniform distance distribution.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.\n\n### 6. **Saving Algorithm**\n**Function:** `saving_algorithm_710e`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for merging routes and reducing the number of routes. Best when initial routes are highly fragmented.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Fragmentation of Routes:** High fragmentation in initial routes.\n  - **Merge Threshold:** Determines the feasibility of merging routes.\n  - **Vehicle Capacity:** High capacity to allow for more merges.\n\n### 7. **Random Heuristic**\n**Function:** `random_bfdc`\n- **Scenario:** Useful for generating diverse initial solutions or as a baseline. Can be used to escape local optima by introducing randomness.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Solution Diversity:** High need for diverse solutions.\n  - **Iteration Count:** Used in combination with other heuristics for multiple iterations.\n\n### 8. **Petal Algorithm**\n**Function:** `petal_algorithm_b384`\n- **Scenario:** Good for creating routes around the depot, forming loops. Effective when nodes are clustered around the depot.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Clustering:** High clustering near the depot.\n  - **Route Lengths:** Creates routes of similar lengths.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.\n\n### 9. **Farthest Insertion**\n**Function:** `farthest_insertion_ce2b`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for ensuring distant nodes are considered early. Good for sparse distributions of nodes.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Node Distribution:** Sparse distribution of nodes.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.\n\n### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes**\n**Function:** `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`\n- **Scenario:** Useful for balancing loads and improving route efficiency. Best when routes are unbalanced.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Load Imbalance:** High imbalance in vehicle loads.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** Moderate to high variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** High demand variability.\n\n### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion**\n**Function:** `min_cost_insertion_7bfa`\n- **Scenario:** Effective for inserting nodes in a way that minimizes cost increases. Best for refining solutions.\n- **Quantification:**\n  - **Insertion Opportunities:** High number of insertion points.\n  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.\n  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.\n\nEach of these heuristics has its strengths and is best suited to certain problem characteristics. By analyzing the specific features of the CVRP instance (e.g., node density, distance distribution, demand variability), you can select the most appropriate heuristic or combination thereof to achieve an efficient solution."

How does None perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.

Here's a brief analysis of the situation:\n\n### Analysis\n- **Node Count:** 78 nodes, which is moderately large, providing ample room for optimization.\n- **Vehicle Count:** 10 vehicles, which means we need to balance load distribution effectively.\n- **Vehicle Capacity:** 100 units, and the demands vary, with some nodes having high demands (up to 26 units).\n- **Initial State:** All vehicles have zero load, and no nodes have been visited yet.\n- **Distance Metrics:** An average distance of approximately 50.88 with a standard deviation of 26.01 indicates moderate variability in distances.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven that we are starting from scratch, it is crucial to quickly construct an initial feasible solution that can then be refined. Based on the characteristics of the problem and the available heuristics, the following approach is recommended:\n\n1. **Construct Initial Solution:**\n   - **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic:** This heuristic is straightforward and efficient for constructing an initial solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node to the current route.\n\n2. **Refine the Solution:**\n   - **Two-Opt Heuristic:** After constructing an initial solution, applying the two-opt heuristic can help in refining the solution by optimizing the routes locally.\n\n### Decision\nLet's start with the **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic** to construct the initial routes. After that, we can evaluate the solution and decide on further refinement steps.\n\n**Selected Heuristic:**\n- **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic:** This heuristic will help construct an initial solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node to the current route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints.\n\n### Run Heuristic\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nrunning steps: 10\nexplanation: We will use the nearest neighbor heuristic to construct the initial routes for the vehicles. This heuristic is efficient for building a feasible starting solution by considering the nearest unvisited nodes, which will help in creating a good base for further refinements.\n***\n\nAfter running the nearest neighbor heuristic for 10 steps, we will review the updated solution state and decide on the next steps."
