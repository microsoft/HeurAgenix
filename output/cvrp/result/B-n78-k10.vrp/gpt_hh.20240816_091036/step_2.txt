I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is cvrp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, I can help analyze the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm might be most applicable, along with how these scenarios can be quantified. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic**
**Function:** `two_opt_0554`
- **Scenario:** Best used when you have an initial solution that needs refinement. It’s effective for local optimization by removing two edges and reconnecting the nodes to reduce the total travel distance.
- **Quantification:** 
  - **Initial Solution Quality:** If the initial solution has a high total travel distance.
  - **Average Distance:** Works well when the average distance between nodes is high.
  - **Standard Deviation of Distance:** If the standard deviation is low, indicating more uniform distances, making it easier to optimize locally.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search**
**Function:** `variable_neighborhood_search_614b`
- **Scenario:** Effective in escaping local optima by changing the neighborhood structures. Useful when the solution is stuck in a local optimum.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Current Solution Quality:** If the current solution is near a local optimum.
  - **Diversity in Routes:** Effective when there is a variety in route lengths and structures.
  - **Iteration Count:** More iterations may be required for large problem instances.

### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic**
**Function:** `three_opt_e8d7`
- **Scenario:** Similar to the two-opt but more powerful as it considers three edges. Best for refining solutions with potential complex interchanges.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Initial Solution Quality:** If the initial solution has a moderate to high total travel distance.
  - **Average Distance:** Useful when average distances are moderate, providing more opportunities for improvement.
  - **Standard Deviation of Distance:** Works well with moderate standard deviation.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor**
**Function:** `nearest_neighbor_99ba`
- **Scenario:** Simple and fast, best for constructing initial solutions. Good for problems with a dense node distribution near the depot.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Node Density:** High node density near the depot.
  - **Demand Distribution:** Uniform demand distribution.
  - **Vehicle Capacity:** Moderate to high capacity, reducing the chance of route termination due to capacity constraints.

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic**
**Function:** `greedy_f4c4`
- **Scenario:** Efficient for quickly generating a feasible solution. Suitable when time is a constraint.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Node Density:** High node density.
  - **Distance Distribution:** Works better with a uniform distance distribution.
  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm**
**Function:** `saving_algorithm_710e`
- **Scenario:** Effective for merging routes and reducing the number of routes. Best when initial routes are highly fragmented.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Fragmentation of Routes:** High fragmentation in initial routes.
  - **Merge Threshold:** Determines the feasibility of merging routes.
  - **Vehicle Capacity:** High capacity to allow for more merges.

### 7. **Random Heuristic**
**Function:** `random_bfdc`
- **Scenario:** Useful for generating diverse initial solutions or as a baseline. Can be used to escape local optima by introducing randomness.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Solution Diversity:** High need for diverse solutions.
  - **Iteration Count:** Used in combination with other heuristics for multiple iterations.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm**
**Function:** `petal_algorithm_b384`
- **Scenario:** Good for creating routes around the depot, forming loops. Effective when nodes are clustered around the depot.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Node Clustering:** High clustering near the depot.
  - **Route Lengths:** Creates routes of similar lengths.
  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate demand distribution.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion**
**Function:** `farthest_insertion_ce2b`
- **Scenario:** Effective for ensuring distant nodes are considered early. Good for sparse distributions of nodes.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Node Distribution:** Sparse distribution of nodes.
  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.
  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes**
**Function:** `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`
- **Scenario:** Useful for balancing loads and improving route efficiency. Best when routes are unbalanced.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Load Imbalance:** High imbalance in vehicle loads.
  - **Distance Matrix:** Moderate to high variability in distances.
  - **Demand Distribution:** High demand variability.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion**
**Function:** `min_cost_insertion_7bfa`
- **Scenario:** Effective for inserting nodes in a way that minimizes cost increases. Best for refining solutions.
- **Quantification:**
  - **Insertion Opportunities:** High number of insertion points.
  - **Distance Matrix:** High variability in distances.
  - **Demand Distribution:** Moderate to high demand.

Each of these heuristics has its strengths and is best suited to certain problem characteristics. By analyzing the specific features of the CVRP instance (e.g., node density, distance distribution, demand variability), you can select the most appropriate heuristic or combination thereof to achieve an efficient solution.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: We will use the nearest neighbor heuristic to construct the initial routes for the vehicles. This heuristic is efficient for building a feasible starting solution by considering the nearest unvisited nodes, which will help in creating a good base for further refinements.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 29.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 94
---Round 1---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: We will use the Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic to explore multiple neighborhoods and improve the current solution. This heuristic will help in balancing the load across all vehicles and potentially reduce the total cost.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 190.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 199

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: variable_neighborhood_search_614b. How does variable_neighborhood_search_614b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:

Based on the provided data and historical context, here is a detailed analysis and recommendation:

### Current State Analysis
- **Visited Nodes:** 26
- **Unvisited Nodes:** 52
- **Fulfilled Demands:** 293
- **Remaining Demands:** 644
- **Total Current Cost:** 219.0

### Vehicle Information
- **Vehicle 0:** Route: [17, 72, 58, 38, 69, 43, 67, 21, 24, 1], Current Cost: 29.0, Load: 94, Remaining Capacity: 6
- **Vehicle 1:** Route: [2, 27, 49, 65, 47, 56, 52], Current Cost: 75.0, Load: 99, Remaining Capacity: 1
- **Vehicle 2:** Route: [8, 34, 75, 37, 70, 30, 5, 63], Current Cost: 115.0, Load: 100, Remaining Capacity: 0
- **Vehicles 3-9:** Empty, Load: 0, Remaining Capacity: 100

### Considerations for Next Steps
1. **Balancing Load and Reducing Costs:** Vehicles 3-9 are currently unused, which indicates a potential imbalance. There is a need to distribute the load more evenly across all vehicles to make better use of available capacity.
2. **Improving Solution Quality:** While the nearest neighbor and variable neighborhood search heuristics have made progress, there remains a significant number of unvisited nodes and unmet demands. Further refinement is necessary.

### Recommendation
Given the current state and goals, the **Node Shift Between Routes** heuristic appears promising for balancing the load and potentially reducing costs by moving nodes between routes.

### Selected Heuristic and Explanation
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a
running steps: 10
explanation: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic will help balance the load across all vehicles by moving nodes between routes. This can reduce the total distance and improve the utilization of all vehicles. Given the current state, where some vehicles are fully loaded while others are empty, this heuristic is expected to make significant improvements.
***

Let's proceed with this heuristic and run it for 10 steps to see its impact on the current solution. After these steps, we will review the performance and decide on further actions.
