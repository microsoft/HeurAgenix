This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\n\nImprovement Heuristics: These heuristics improve an existing solution by modifying the routes, utilizing techniques like 2-opt, 3-opt, and neighborhood search to find better solutions.\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nRoute Construction Heuristics: These heuristics construct routes from scratch using specific strategies like greedy approaches, petal structures, and savings calculation.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\nInter-route Optimization: These heuristics aim at optimizing the solution by moving nodes between different routes to balance loads or reduce costs.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nnode_num:78\nvehicle_num:10\ncapacity:100\ndepot:0\ndemands:[0, 14, 17, 17, 16, 19, 17, 5, 12, 4, 2, 2, 26, 2, 7, 18, 6, 6, 18, 2, 14, 5, 9, 4, 3, 15, 4, 23, 7, 21, 4, 1, 6, 16, 4, 20, 5, 14, 14, 26, 5, 2, 14, 11, 21, 20, 18, 2, 19, 12, 22, 14, 23, 25, 8, 3, 9, 21, 3, 22, 6, 2, 22, 20, 5, 13, 6, 14, 16, 12, 23, 5, 12, 15, 21, 4, 23, 19]\naverage_demand:12.012820512820513\ndemand_variance:56.884451019066404\naverage_distance:50.875124875124875\nmax_distance:108.0\nmin_distance:0.0\ndistance_variance:677.8029210217022\nvehicle_capacity_utilization:0.937\nnode_to_vehicle_ratio:7.8\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 3 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Below is a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Route Construction\n- **Objective:** Create an initial feasible solution.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories:**\n  1. **Route Construction Heuristics:** Start with a basic structure.\n     - **Execution Steps:**\n       - Begin with a **Greedy Approach** to quickly establish a baseline solution, considering the shortest distance from the last node.\n       - Use the **Petal Algorithm** to construct loop-based routes, which can be advantageous in scenarios with clustered nodes.\n       - Briefly test the **Savings Algorithm** to see if merging routes based on cost savings is beneficial, especially if initial routes are far from optimal.\n     - Evaluate the performance of each heuristic based on route compactness and feasibility.\n\n### Phase 2: Initial Solution Improvement\n- **Objective:** Improve the initial solution's cost and feasibility.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories:**\n  1. **Improvement Heuristics:** Focus on refining the current solution.\n     - **Execution Steps:**\n       - Apply **2-opt** to eliminate crossing routes and improve compactness.\n       - Use **3-opt** for more complex route adjustments, if feasible within computational limits.\n       - Implement **Variable Neighborhood Search** to explore different neighborhood structures and escape local optima.\n     - Assess the reduction in total cost and improvement in route efficiency.\n\n### Phase 3: Inter-route Optimization\n- **Objective:** Optimize routes by balancing loads and minimizing costs.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories:**\n  1. **Inter-route Optimization:**\n     - **Execution Steps:**\n       - Employ **Node Shift Between Routes** to balance vehicle loads and reduce costs.\n       - Re-evaluate the **Savings Algorithm** with adjusted parameters to merge routes more effectively, considering the utilization rate.\n     - Monitor changes in vehicle capacity utilization and total distance.\n\n### Phase 4: Iterative Improvement and Finalization\n- **Objective:** Refine the solution iteratively for optimal performance.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories:**\n  1. **Insertion Heuristics:** Fine-tune routes by strategic node insertions.\n     - **Execution Steps:**\n       - Implement **Farthest Insertion** to insert nodes that are strategically distant but critical for route optimization.\n       - Use **Min-Cost Insertion** to fill remaining vehicle capacities with minimal additional cost.\n       - Try **Nearest Neighbor** for last-mile adjustments, especially for nodes with high demand.\n     - Continuously assess the solution's stability and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### General Strategy\n- **Alternation and Evaluation:** Regularly alternate between heuristic categories and evaluate their performance after each phase. This allows for adjustments based on observed improvements or setbacks.\n- **Adaptation:** Be ready to adapt the strategy based on the problem's specific demands and the heuristics' performance. Use data-driven insights to inform decisions on which heuristics to prioritize or revisit.\n- **Experimentation:** Embrace an iterative approach, allowing for experimentation with different heuristics to understand their impact on the solution quality.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically approach the CVRP with flexibility and precision, ensuring that you leverage the strengths of different heuristic categories at appropriate stages of the problem-solving process."

This category can help efficiently integrate the remaining unvisited nodes into the current routes. Insertion Heuristics will allow for a focused enhancement of the solution by filling gaps left by the initial construction and improvement phases, particularly optimizing node-to-vehicle allocations while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n***"
