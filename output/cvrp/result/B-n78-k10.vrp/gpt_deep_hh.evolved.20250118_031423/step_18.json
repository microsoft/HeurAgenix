This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\n\nImprovement Heuristics: These heuristics improve an existing solution by modifying the routes, utilizing techniques like 2-opt, 3-opt, and neighborhood search to find better solutions.\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nRoute Construction Heuristics: These heuristics construct routes from scratch using specific strategies like greedy approaches, petal structures, and savings calculation.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\nInter-route Optimization: These heuristics aim at optimizing the solution by moving nodes between different routes to balance loads or reduce costs.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 3 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

This allows for adjustments based on observed improvements or setbacks.\n- **Adaptation:** Be ready to adapt the strategy based on the problem's specific demands and the heuristics' performance. Use data-driven insights to inform decisions on which heuristics to prioritize or revisit.\n- **Experimentation:** Embrace an iterative approach, allowing for experimentation with different heuristics to understand their impact on the solution quality.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically approach the CVRP with flexibility and precision, ensuring that you leverage the strengths of different heuristic categories at appropriate stages of the problem-solving process."

By optimizing the current routes with Improvement Heuristics such as 2-opt or 3-opt, we can potentially reduce the total cost and free up additional capacity. This will make it easier to integrate the remaining nodes in subsequent steps and ensure that the solution continues to evolve toward optimality.\nVisited Node Num: 21->21\nCurrent Cost: 254.0->254.0\nFulfilled Demands: 238->238\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nHeuristic Category: Insertion Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, with 57 nodes still unvisited and several vehicles with full remaining capacity, it is strategic to focus on integrating these unvisited nodes into the existing routes. Insertion Heuristics can help efficiently allocate these remaining nodes based on demand and capacity constraints, potentially reducing overall cost and improving route utilization. The previous use of Improvement Heuristics has optimized the current routes, so the next logical step is to continue building upon this foundation by strategically inserting unvisited nodes.\nVisited Node Num: 21->24\nCurrent Cost: 254.0->268.0\nFulfilled Demands: 238->275\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nHeuristic Category: Insertion Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain:  Given the current state, there are still 54 unvisited nodes, and many vehicles have full remaining capacity. Continuing with Insertion Heuristics is strategic to efficiently allocate these remaining nodes into existing routes based on demand and capacity constraints. This approach can help improve node-to-vehicle allocation and potentially reduce overall cost by focusing on strategic insertions. Since the previous improvement steps have optimized the existing routes to some extent, further insertion should build on this foundation to enhance the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 24->27\nCurrent Cost: 268.0->301.0\nFulfilled Demands: 275->298\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nHeuristic Category: Improvement Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, where three vehicles are fully loaded and many nodes remain unvisited, it would be strategic to optimize the existing routes before attempting further insertions. Improvement Heuristics can help reduce the total cost and potentially free up capacity by optimizing route efficiency. Techniques such as 2-opt or 3-opt could eliminate unnecessary route overlaps, leading to better utilization of vehicle capacity. Once the existing routes are optimized, it will be easier to integrate additional nodes in subsequent steps.\nVisited Node Num: 27->27\nCurrent Cost: 301.0->301.0\nFulfilled Demands: 298->298\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_6308\nHeuristic Category: Insertion Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: Given the current solution state, with a significant number of nodes (51) still unvisited and substantial remaining vehicle capacity, it is strategic to focus on integrating these unvisited nodes into existing routes. Insertion Heuristics can help efficiently allocate these remaining nodes based on demand and capacity constraints, potentially improving vehicle utilization and overall solution cost. Since recent improvements have optimized existing routes, further insertion should leverage this foundation to enhance the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 27->27\nCurrent Cost: 301.0->295.0\nFulfilled Demands: 298->298\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nHeuristic Category: Inter-route Optimization\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain:  Given the current solution state, a significant number of nodes remain unvisited, and there is substantial remaining vehicle capacity in most vehicles. While Insertion Heuristics have been effective in integrating nodes into existing routes, focusing on Inter-route Optimization could help balance vehicle loads and reduce costs by moving nodes between different routes. This could improve the utilization of underused vehicles and potentially open up capacity in fully loaded routes, allowing for more efficient node insertions in subsequent steps.\nVisited Node Num: 27->27\nCurrent Cost: 295.0->294.0\nFulfilled Demands: 298->298\n---Round 14---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: Insertion Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: Given the current state, with 51 nodes still unvisited and many vehicles having full remaining capacity, it is strategic to focus on integrating these unvisited nodes into existing routes. Insertion Heuristics can efficiently allocate these remaining nodes based on demand and capacity constraints, potentially improving vehicle utilization and overall solution cost. Since recent improvements have optimized existing routes, further insertion should leverage this foundation to enhance the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 27->28\nCurrent Cost: 294.0->350.0\nFulfilled Demands: 298->317\n---Round 15---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nHeuristic Category: Improvement Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: Given the current state, where a substantial number of nodes remain unvisited and three vehicles are fully loaded, focusing on Improvement Heuristics could help optimize the existing routes for better efficiency and potentially free up capacity. By applying techniques like 2-opt or 3-opt, the current solution could be refined to reduce costs and improve route compactness, making it easier to integrate additional nodes in subsequent steps. This approach will enhance the solution quality before proceeding with further node insertions or inter-route optimizations.\nVisited Node Num: 28->31\nCurrent Cost: 350.0->356.0\nFulfilled Demands: 317->346\n---Round 16---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nHeuristic Category: Insertion Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, there are still 47 unvisited nodes and substantial remaining vehicle capacity in several vehicles. Insertion Heuristics can effectively integrate these unvisited nodes into existing routes while considering demand and capacity constraints. This approach will help improve node-to-vehicle allocation and potentially enhance the overall solution by filling remaining capacity and reducing costs. Since recent improvements have optimized existing routes, further insertion should leverage this foundation to enhance the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 31->34\nCurrent Cost: 356.0->385.0\nFulfilled Demands: 346->358\n---Round 17---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: Improvement Heuristics\nRunning Steps: 3\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, where some vehicles are fully loaded and others have significant remaining capacity, focusing on Improvement Heuristics could help optimize existing routes for better efficiency and potentially free up capacity.
