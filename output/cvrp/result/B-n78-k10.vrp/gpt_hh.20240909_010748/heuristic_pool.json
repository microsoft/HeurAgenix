This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

                "text": "Certainly, let's analyze the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm might be most applicable for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The best scenario for a particular heuristic can depend on various factors such as problem size, distribution of nodes, and time constraints. Here's a brief analysis for each heuristic:\n\n1. **Farthest Insertion (CE2B)**:\n   - Applicable when the goal is to minimize the number of routes, as it starts by connecting the most distant points.\n   - Best for sparse networks where some customers are much farther than others.\n\n2. **Greedy (F4C4)**:\n   - Suitable for quick, simple solutions, especially when computation time is limited.\n   - Performs well when customers are evenly distributed.\n\n3. **Min-Cost Insertion (7BFA)**:\n   - Useful when precise cost calculations are essential, and there is a need to minimize the increase in total route cost.\n   - Can be more effective for densely populated networks with many potential insertion points.\n\n4. **Nearest Neighbor (99BA)**:\n   - Ideal for creating initial solutions quickly or when the problem size is small.\n   - Best when customers are relatively evenly distributed.\n\n5. **Node Shift Between Routes (7B8A)**:\n   - Applicable for improving existing solutions by optimizing load balance and reducing total distance.\n   - Useful for adjusting solutions in larger instances where some routes may be significantly longer or more loaded than others.\n\n6. **Petal Algorithm (B384)**:\n   - Good for constructing initial solutions that are inherently feasible with respect to vehicle capacity.\n   - Best for problems where creating loops from the depot is efficient, such as when customers are radially distributed around the depot.\n\n7. **Random (BFDC)**:\n   - Typically used as a baseline for comparison or within a stochastic search framework.\n   - Can be surprisingly effective when combined with improvement heuristics in large, complex problems.\n\n8. **Saving Algorithm (710E)**:\n   - Most effective in instances where there is potential to combine routes for savings, often in problems with clustered customers.\n   - The merge threshold parameter can be tuned for problems with varying degrees of customer density.\n\n9. **Three-Opt (E8D7)**:\n   - Suitable for refining solutions to local optima, particularly when the solution space is rugged.\n   - Often used after another heuristic has been applied to improve the solution further.\n\n10. **Two-Opt (0554)**:\n    - Commonly used to quickly eliminate route crossings and improve an existing solution.\n    - Works best when there are clear opportunities to shorten routes by reordering stops.\n\n11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (614B)**:\n    - Versatile for escaping local optima, especially in large and complex problems.\n    - Best when multiple neighborhood structures can be defined and exploited to explore the solution space effectively.\n\nQuantifying the best scenarios for each algorithm can involve metrics such as:\n\n- **Problem Size**: Number of nodes, vehicles, and overall network density.\n- **Node Distribution**: Whether nodes are clustered, randomly distributed, or have some other pattern.\n- **Time Constraints**: Whether a quick solution is needed or there is time for extensive search.\n- **Solution Quality**: Acceptable trade-off between solution quality and computation time.\n- **Initial Solution**: Whether a good initial solution is available or needs to be generated.\n- **Complexity of Constraints**: The strictness and complexity of capacity and route constraints.\n\nEach heuristic has strengths and weaknesses, and often a combination of heuristics or a metaheuristic approach may yield the best results. For example, one could use a greedy or nearest-neighbor heuristic to generate an initial solution and then apply a two-opt or three-opt to refine it. Variable Neighborhood Search can further improve the solution by exploring different neighborhood structures."
