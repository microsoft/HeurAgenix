I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.

Understood. You are working on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and have created a framework to handle solutions and apply heuristic operators to those solutions. The `Solution` class represents the routes of each vehicle, and various operator classes (`AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSegmentOperator`, `RelocateOperator`, and `MergeRoutesOperator`) are used to modify the solutions according to different heuristic strategies.

You have also defined a standardized heuristic function signature that takes in global data (static information about the problem), state data (dynamic information about the current state), algorithm data (specific to the heuristic algorithm being used), a `get_state_data_function` (to generate the state dictionary for a new solution), and additional hyperparameters. The function returns a tuple containing an operator instance and an updated algorithm dictionary for ongoing or future heuristic processing.

I'll remember the information about the problem and your framework as we progress to the next steps in your project. Feel free to proceed with describing the challenges you're encountering when you're ready.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, let's analyze the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm might be most applicable for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The best scenario for a particular heuristic can depend on various factors such as problem size, distribution of nodes, and time constraints. Here's a brief analysis for each heuristic:

1. **Farthest Insertion (CE2B)**:
   - Applicable when the goal is to minimize the number of routes, as it starts by connecting the most distant points.
   - Best for sparse networks where some customers are much farther than others.

2. **Greedy (F4C4)**:
   - Suitable for quick, simple solutions, especially when computation time is limited.
   - Performs well when customers are evenly distributed.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion (7BFA)**:
   - Useful when precise cost calculations are essential, and there is a need to minimize the increase in total route cost.
   - Can be more effective for densely populated networks with many potential insertion points.

4. **Nearest Neighbor (99BA)**:
   - Ideal for creating initial solutions quickly or when the problem size is small.
   - Best when customers are relatively evenly distributed.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes (7B8A)**:
   - Applicable for improving existing solutions by optimizing load balance and reducing total distance.
   - Useful for adjusting solutions in larger instances where some routes may be significantly longer or more loaded than others.

6. **Petal Algorithm (B384)**:
   - Good for constructing initial solutions that are inherently feasible with respect to vehicle capacity.
   - Best for problems where creating loops from the depot is efficient, such as when customers are radially distributed around the depot.

7. **Random (BFDC)**:
   - Typically used as a baseline for comparison or within a stochastic search framework.
   - Can be surprisingly effective when combined with improvement heuristics in large, complex problems.

8. **Saving Algorithm (710E)**:
   - Most effective in instances where there is potential to combine routes for savings, often in problems with clustered customers.
   - The merge threshold parameter can be tuned for problems with varying degrees of customer density.

9. **Three-Opt (E8D7)**:
   - Suitable for refining solutions to local optima, particularly when the solution space is rugged.
   - Often used after another heuristic has been applied to improve the solution further.

10. **Two-Opt (0554)**:
    - Commonly used to quickly eliminate route crossings and improve an existing solution.
    - Works best when there are clear opportunities to shorten routes by reordering stops.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (614B)**:
    - Versatile for escaping local optima, especially in large and complex problems.
    - Best when multiple neighborhood structures can be defined and exploited to explore the solution space effectively.

Quantifying the best scenarios for each algorithm can involve metrics such as:

- **Problem Size**: Number of nodes, vehicles, and overall network density.
- **Node Distribution**: Whether nodes are clustered, randomly distributed, or have some other pattern.
- **Time Constraints**: Whether a quick solution is needed or there is time for extensive search.
- **Solution Quality**: Acceptable trade-off between solution quality and computation time.
- **Initial Solution**: Whether a good initial solution is available or needs to be generated.
- **Complexity of Constraints**: The strictness and complexity of capacity and route constraints.

Each heuristic has strengths and weaknesses, and often a combination of heuristics or a metaheuristic approach may yield the best results. For example, one could use a greedy or nearest-neighbor heuristic to generate an initial solution and then apply a two-opt or three-opt to refine it. Variable Neighborhood Search can further improve the solution by exploring different neighborhood structures.

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The greedy heuristic is selected to build the initial routes efficiently. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route, while also considering the vehicle's capacity constraints. This should provide a reasonable starting point for the solution with 20 steps allowing for each vehicle to begin forming its route without immediately optimizing for the global minimum, which is more effectively done once a baseline solution is established.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 20
Delta of Current Cost: 240.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 251
---Round 1---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The farthest insertion heuristic is chosen to continue building routes by including distant unvisited nodes, aiming to maximize coverage and route efficiency. Fifteen steps are proposed to allow for substantial development of the solution without locking into a particular configuration too early in the process.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 547.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 182
---Round 2---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Saving Algorithm is chosen for its ability to effectively combine routes for savings in distance. Given that we have several partially filled routes and some vehicles with remaining capacity, this heuristic can help to consolidate routes and reduce the total distance traveled. The merge threshold of 0.1 is chosen to prevent overly aggressive merging that might lead to suboptimal route combinations. Running this heuristic for 10 steps allows us to observe its impact on the solution without committing too many changes at once.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is selected as it can help integrate the unvisited nodes into the existing routes in a cost-effective manner. It considers both the insertion cost and vehicle capacity constraints, which should help in better distributing the remaining demands across the available vehicle capacity. Running this heuristic for 15 steps will allow us to incrementally improve the solution while keeping the overall structure flexible for further enhancements.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 185.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 135
---Round 4---
Heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic allows for the adjustment of the existing routes to potentially free up capacity on the fully loaded vehicles, which can then be used to pick up some of the remaining high-demand nodes. This could also help in improving load balance and reducing total distance. By running it for 5 steps, we can make incremental changes that may open up new possibilities for the remaining unvisited nodes without causing significant disruption to the current solution structure.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -85.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: This heuristic is selected to assign the closest unvisited nodes to vehicles with available capacity. Running it for 10 steps should allow us to incorporate a significant number of the remaining unvisited nodes into the current routes, while also making sure that the vehicles do not exceed their capacity. This may also help in reducing the total distance by assigning nodes that are near to the last visited nodes of each route.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 187.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 85
---Round 6---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is appropriate for continuing to integrate the remaining unvisited nodes with higher demands into the current routes efficiently. It takes into account both the cost of insertion and the vehicle's remaining capacity, which is crucial given the varied remaining capacities of the vehicles. Running the heuristic for 10 steps allows for a significant improvement without committing too many changes, thereby maintaining flexibility for future adjustments.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 209.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 149

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: min_cost_insertion_7bfa. How does min_cost_insertion_7bfa perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx

2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:

Given the current solution state and the performance of the last heuristic (min_cost_insertion_7bfa), which has been applied twice and has improved the solution by integrating unvisited nodes and considering insertion costs and vehicle capacities, it seems that the solution is approaching a more refined state. However, there are still unvisited nodes, and some vehicles have remaining capacity that can be utilized.

With only 7 unvisited nodes left and a relatively small total remaining demand, it's important to choose a heuristic that can effectively and efficiently assign these nodes to the appropriate routes without significantly increasing the total cost or violating capacity constraints.

Considering the state data and the performance of the previous heuristics, it might be beneficial to switch to a heuristic that can fine-tune the current solution by making local improvements or by finding suitable routes for the remaining unvisited nodes.

Given that we have some vehicles with low route lengths and remaining capacity, a heuristic like the **Nearest Neighbor (99BA)** could be suitable to quickly assign the nearest unvisited nodes to vehicles with available capacity, potentially reducing the average unvisited node demand.

Moreover, since the **Min-Cost Insertion (7BFA)** has been run recently, it would be prudent to continue with it for a few more steps to ensure that the remaining nodes are inserted in a cost-effective manner, taking advantage of the different capacities and locations of the vehicles.

Therefore, the recommendation is as follows:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
running steps: 5
explanation: With only a few unvisited nodes remaining and some vehicle capacity left, the Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is poised to effectively integrate these nodes into the existing solution. Running it for an additional 5 steps allows us to methodically improve the solution while taking advantage of the current distribution of loads and the proximity of the remaining nodes to the existing routes. This should help to maintain or improve the solution validity and utilize the remaining vehicle capacities without incurring excessive additional costs.
