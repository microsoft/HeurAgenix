This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

                "text": "Certainly, let's analyze the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm might be most applicable for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The best scenario for a particular heuristic can depend on various factors such as problem size, distribution of nodes, and time constraints. Here's a brief analysis for each heuristic:\n\n1. **Farthest Insertion (CE2B)**:\n   - Applicable when the goal is to minimize the number of routes, as it starts by connecting the most distant points.\n   - Best for sparse networks where some customers are much farther than others.\n\n2. **Greedy (F4C4)**:\n   - Suitable for quick, simple solutions, especially when computation time is limited.\n   - Performs well when customers are evenly distributed.\n\n3. **Min-Cost Insertion (7BFA)**:\n   - Useful when precise cost calculations are essential, and there is a need to minimize the increase in total route cost.\n   - Can be more effective for densely populated networks with many potential insertion points.\n\n4. **Nearest Neighbor (99BA)**:\n   - Ideal for creating initial solutions quickly or when the problem size is small.\n   - Best when customers are relatively evenly distributed.\n\n5. **Node Shift Between Routes (7B8A)**:\n   - Applicable for improving existing solutions by optimizing load balance and reducing total distance.\n   - Useful for adjusting solutions in larger instances where some routes may be significantly longer or more loaded than others.\n\n6. **Petal Algorithm (B384)**:\n   - Good for constructing initial solutions that are inherently feasible with respect to vehicle capacity.\n   - Best for problems where creating loops from the depot is efficient, such as when customers are radially distributed around the depot.\n\n7. **Random (BFDC)**:\n   - Typically used as a baseline for comparison or within a stochastic search framework.\n   - Can be surprisingly effective when combined with improvement heuristics in large, complex problems.\n\n8. **Saving Algorithm (710E)**:\n   - Most effective in instances where there is potential to combine routes for savings, often in problems with clustered customers.\n   - The merge threshold parameter can be tuned for problems with varying degrees of customer density.\n\n9. **Three-Opt (E8D7)**:\n   - Suitable for refining solutions to local optima, particularly when the solution space is rugged.\n   - Often used after another heuristic has been applied to improve the solution further.\n\n10. **Two-Opt (0554)**:\n    - Commonly used to quickly eliminate route crossings and improve an existing solution.\n    - Works best when there are clear opportunities to shorten routes by reordering stops.\n\n11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (614B)**:\n    - Versatile for escaping local optima, especially in large and complex problems.\n    - Best when multiple neighborhood structures can be defined and exploited to explore the solution space effectively.\n\nQuantifying the best scenarios for each algorithm can involve metrics such as:\n\n- **Problem Size**: Number of nodes, vehicles, and overall network density.\n- **Node Distribution**: Whether nodes are clustered, randomly distributed, or have some other pattern.\n- **Time Constraints**: Whether a quick solution is needed or there is time for extensive search.\n- **Solution Quality**: Acceptable trade-off between solution quality and computation time.\n- **Initial Solution**: Whether a good initial solution is available or needs to be generated.\n- **Complexity of Constraints**: The strictness and complexity of capacity and route constraints.\n\nEach heuristic has strengths and weaknesses, and often a combination of heuristics or a metaheuristic approach may yield the best results. For example, one could use a greedy or nearest-neighbor heuristic to generate an initial solution and then apply a two-opt or three-opt to refine it. Variable Neighborhood Search can further improve the solution by exploring different neighborhood structures."

It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route, while also considering the vehicle's capacity constraints. This should provide a reasonable starting point for the solution with 20 steps allowing for each vehicle to begin forming its route without immediately optimizing for the global minimum, which is more effectively done once a baseline solution is established.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 20\nDelta of Current Cost: 240.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 251\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: farthest_insertion_ce2b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The farthest insertion heuristic is chosen to continue building routes by including distant unvisited nodes, aiming to maximize coverage and route efficiency. Fifteen steps are proposed to allow for substantial development of the solution without locking into a particular configuration too early in the process.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 547.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 182\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Saving Algorithm is chosen for its ability to effectively combine routes for savings in distance. Given that we have several partially filled routes and some vehicles with remaining capacity, this heuristic can help to consolidate routes and reduce the total distance traveled. The merge threshold of 0.1 is chosen to prevent overly aggressive merging that might lead to suboptimal route combinations. Running this heuristic for 10 steps allows us to observe its impact on the solution without committing too many changes at once.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is selected as it can help integrate the unvisited nodes into the existing routes in a cost-effective manner. It considers both the insertion cost and vehicle capacity constraints, which should help in better distributing the remaining demands across the available vehicle capacity. Running this heuristic for 15 steps will allow us to incrementally improve the solution while keeping the overall structure flexible for further enhancements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 185.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 135\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic allows for the adjustment of the existing routes to potentially free up capacity on the fully loaded vehicles, which can then be used to pick up some of the remaining high-demand nodes. This could also help in improving load balance and reducing total distance. By running it for 5 steps, we can make incremental changes that may open up new possibilities for the remaining unvisited nodes without causing significant disruption to the current solution structure.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -85.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: This heuristic is selected to assign the closest unvisited nodes to vehicles with available capacity. Running it for 10 steps should allow us to incorporate a significant number of the remaining unvisited nodes into the current routes, while also making sure that the vehicles do not exceed their capacity. This may also help in reducing the total distance by assigning nodes that are near to the last visited nodes of each route.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 187.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 85\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is appropriate for continuing to integrate the remaining unvisited nodes with higher demands into the current routes efficiently. It takes into account both the cost of insertion and the vehicle's remaining capacity, which is crucial given the varied remaining capacities of the vehicles. Running the heuristic for 10 steps allows for a significant improvement without committing too many changes, thereby maintaining flexibility for future adjustments.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 209.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 149\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: With only a few unvisited nodes remaining and some vehicle capacity left, the Min-Cost Insertion heuristic is poised to effectively integrate these nodes into the existing solution. Running it for an additional 5 steps allows us to methodically improve the solution while taking advantage of the current distribution of loads and the proximity of the remaining nodes to the existing routes. This should help to maintain or improve the solution validity and utilize the remaining vehicle capacities without incurring excessive additional costs.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 183.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 95\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 2\nExplain: The min_cost_insertion_7bfa heuristic should be used to finalize the solution by integrating the two remaining unvisited nodes in a cost-effective way. With only two nodes left and sufficient remaining vehicle capacity, it's likely that we can complete the solution in just two steps, minimizing any additional routing costs and ensuring all demands are met.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 2\nDelta of Current Cost: 106.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 40\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: min_cost_insertion_7bfa. How does min_cost_insertion_7bfa perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

                "text": "Based on the provided state data and the progress made during the previous rounds, it seems that all nodes have been visited, the total demand is served, and the solution is valid. The vehicle capacities are nearly fully utilized, with very little remaining capacity. The current solution appears to be quite efficient, with a total current cost of 1572 and each vehicle's route being reasonably well-balanced in terms of length and load.\n\nGiven that there are no unvisited nodes left and the demands of all nodes are fulfilled, further running of heuristics might only result in marginal improvements if any. The focus would now be on fine-tuning the current solution to potentially lower the total cost further. Since the last applied heuristic was `min_cost_insertion_7bfa` and it was used to successfully integrate all remaining nodes, we might consider a heuristic that optimizes the existing routes without adding new nodes.\n\nConsidering the current solution, a potential next step could be to apply a route improvement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`, which can refine the routes by rearranging the order of visits to reduce the overall travel cost. However, since we need to be cautious about not overcomplicating the routes or increasing the costs through excessive rearrangements, it would be prudent to run these heuristics for a few steps and evaluate their impact.\n\nGiven the average route length and the fact that we aim to maintain the solution's validity, let's proceed with a conservative approach using a route optimization heuristic:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: two_opt_0554\nrunning steps: 5\nexplanation: The two-opt heuristic is chosen to fine-tune the current solution by eliminating any potential route crossings and improving the overall travel distance. Running it for a small number of steps allows us to cautiously enhance the solution without risking the introduction of significant disruptions or inefficiencies.\n***\n\nThis approach seeks to incrementally optimize the total travel cost while preserving the balance and feasibility of the current solution. After running `two_opt_0554` for 5 steps, we can review the solution to determine if further improvements can be made or if the solution is close to optimal."
