I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing scenarios for the applicability of each heuristic in the context of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves understanding the strengths and characteristics of each method. Here’s a breakdown of scenarios where each algorithm might be particularly effective:

1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (farthest_insertion_6308)**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when the distribution of nodes is sparse or when there are outliers that need to be integrated efficiently into existing routes.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when the average distance between nodes is high or when there is a significant variation in distances between nodes. The algorithm is designed to handle nodes that are far from the depot or other nodes effectively.

2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (min_cost_insertion_3b2b)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios where minimizing the immediate cost of adding a node to a route is crucial. This method can be effective in dense networks where many insertion options are available.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the focus is on minimizing incremental costs, particularly in networks where node density is high, and capacity constraints are tight.

3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (nearest_neighbor_54a9)**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in environments where nodes are relatively close to each other, and quick decisions about the next node to visit are needed.
   - **Quantification**: Particularly useful when the demand of nodes varies significantly and the vehicle load needs careful management. Also effective when the node set is small, allowing for periodic 2-opt improvements.

4. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic (node_shift_between_routes_7b8a)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in balancing loads between routes and making small adjustments to improve overall efficiency.
   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where initial solutions are unbalanced in terms of load or route length, and there are opportunities to optimize by shifting nodes.

5. **3-opt Heuristic (three_opt_e8d7)**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for refining existing routes to significantly reduce total travel distance.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal when a relatively good solution exists, but further refinement is needed to optimize path efficiency. Suitable for large datasets where global improvements can lead to significant cost reductions.

6. **2-opt Heuristic (two_opt_0554)**:
   - **Scenario**: A simpler improvement heuristic best used when routes are somewhat optimized but can benefit from local route improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the existing solution is close to optimal, and only local adjustments are needed to improve route compactness and reduce travel distance.

These scenarios are generalized, and the effectiveness of each heuristic may vary based on specific problem instances and constraints. Experimentation and analysis of specific CVRP instances will help determine the most suitable heuristic or combination of heuristics.
