I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing scenarios for the applicability of each heuristic in the context of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves understanding the strengths and characteristics of each method. Hereâs a breakdown of scenarios where each algorithm might be particularly effective:

1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (farthest_insertion_6308)**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when the distribution of nodes is sparse or when there are outliers that need to be integrated efficiently into existing routes.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when the average distance between nodes is high or when there is a significant variation in distances between nodes. The algorithm is designed to handle nodes that are far from the depot or other nodes effectively.

2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (min_cost_insertion_3b2b)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios where minimizing the immediate cost of adding a node to a route is crucial. This method can be effective in dense networks where many insertion options are available.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the focus is on minimizing incremental costs, particularly in networks where node density is high, and capacity constraints are tight.

3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (nearest_neighbor_54a9)**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in environments where nodes are relatively close to each other, and quick decisions about the next node to visit are needed.
   - **Quantification**: Particularly useful when the demand of nodes varies significantly and the vehicle load needs careful management. Also effective when the node set is small, allowing for periodic 2-opt improvements.

4. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic (node_shift_between_routes_7b8a)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in balancing loads between routes and making small adjustments to improve overall efficiency.
   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where initial solutions are unbalanced in terms of load or route length, and there are opportunities to optimize by shifting nodes.

5. **3-opt Heuristic (three_opt_e8d7)**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for refining existing routes to significantly reduce total travel distance.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal when a relatively good solution exists, but further refinement is needed to optimize path efficiency. Suitable for large datasets where global improvements can lead to significant cost reductions.

6. **2-opt Heuristic (two_opt_0554)**:
   - **Scenario**: A simpler improvement heuristic best used when routes are somewhat optimized but can benefit from local route improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the existing solution is close to optimal, and only local adjustments are needed to improve route compactness and reduce travel distance.

These scenarios are generalized, and the effectiveness of each heuristic may vary based on specific problem instances and constraints. Experimentation and analysis of specific CVRP instances will help determine the most suitable heuristic or combination of heuristics.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the initial state where all vehicles are at the depot and no nodes have been visited, the Farthest Insertion Heuristic is suitable to strategically start building routes. This heuristic is effective for handling unvisited nodes by considering insertion costs, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. Starting with this heuristic can help establish a baseline route structure by efficiently integrating the farthest nodes, which typically pose challenges in routing problems.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 34.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 94
---Round 1---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The min_cost_insertion_3b2b heuristic will focus on cost-effective insertions to continue building the solution. It is suited for the current state where strategic node placement is crucial to maintain efficiency and manage capacity effectively across all vehicles.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 143.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 142

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: min_cost_insertion_3b2b. How does min_cost_insertion_3b2b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Given the current state data and the performance of the previous heuristic, "min_cost_insertion_3b2b," it seems that there is a need to continue refining and building the solution further. The current solution still has a significant number of unvisited nodes, and vehicle capacity utilization is not yet optimized.

Considering the available options, the next heuristic could focus on either improving route compactness or effectively managing node insertions with high demand while maintaining cost efficiency. Given the nature of the problem, I suggest using the "nearest_neighbor_54a9" heuristic. This heuristic can effectively prioritize nodes with higher demands and help improve the route compactness through periodic 2-opt improvements.

Here is the recommendation:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
running steps: 10
hype parameter(optional): 
explanation: The nearest_neighbor_54a9 heuristic will focus on integrating unvisited nodes with higher demands while ensuring that the vehicle's remaining capacity is efficiently utilized. This heuristic can also apply periodic 2-opt improvements, which may help enhance route compactness and reduce overall costs. This approach is suitable for the current state, where there is a need to incrementally build upon the existing solution while managing node demands effectively.
