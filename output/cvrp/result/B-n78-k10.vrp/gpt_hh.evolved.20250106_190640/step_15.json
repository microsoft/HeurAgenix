                "text": "Analyzing scenarios for the applicability of each heuristic in the context of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) involves understanding the strengths and characteristics of each method. Here\u2019s a breakdown of scenarios where each algorithm might be particularly effective:\n\n1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (farthest_insertion_6308)**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when the distribution of nodes is sparse or when there are outliers that need to be integrated efficiently into existing routes.\n   - **Quantification**: Best used when the average distance between nodes is high or when there is a significant variation in distances between nodes. The algorithm is designed to handle nodes that are far from the depot or other nodes effectively.\n\n2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (min_cost_insertion_3b2b)**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios where minimizing the immediate cost of adding a node to a route is crucial. This method can be effective in dense networks where many insertion options are available.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the focus is on minimizing incremental costs, particularly in networks where node density is high, and capacity constraints are tight.\n\n3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (nearest_neighbor_54a9)**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in environments where nodes are relatively close to each other, and quick decisions about the next node to visit are needed.\n   - **Quantification**: Particularly useful when the demand of nodes varies significantly and the vehicle load needs careful management. Also effective when the node set is small, allowing for periodic 2-opt improvements.\n\n4. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic (node_shift_between_routes_7b8a)**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful in balancing loads between routes and making small adjustments to improve overall efficiency.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where initial solutions are unbalanced in terms of load or route length, and there are opportunities to optimize by shifting nodes.\n\n5. **3-opt Heuristic (three_opt_e8d7)**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective for refining existing routes to significantly reduce total travel distance.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal when a relatively good solution exists, but further refinement is needed to optimize path efficiency. Suitable for large datasets where global improvements can lead to significant cost reductions.\n\n6. **2-opt Heuristic (two_opt_0554)**:\n   - **Scenario**: A simpler improvement heuristic best used when routes are somewhat optimized but can benefit from local route improvements.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the existing solution is close to optimal, and only local adjustments are needed to improve route compactness and reduce travel distance.\n\nThese scenarios are generalized, and the effectiveness of each heuristic may vary based on specific problem instances and constraints. Experimentation and analysis of specific CVRP instances will help determine the most suitable heuristic or combination of heuristics."

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
