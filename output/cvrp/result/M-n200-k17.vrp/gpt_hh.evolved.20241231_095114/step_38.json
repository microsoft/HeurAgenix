                "text": "Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each of your implemented heuristics is most applicable. Each heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary depending on the problem characteristics. Below is a breakdown of when to use each heuristic and how the scenarios can be quantified:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems with **highly dispersed nodes** where the goal is to create balanced routes across vehicles.\n- Particularly effective when the focus is on **maximizing route compactness** and **utilizing vehicle capacity efficiently**.  \n- Works well for instances where the distance matrix is sparse or the depot is far from most nodes.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Node Dispersion:** High variance in the distance matrix (e.g., variance > threshold).  \n- **Capacity Utilization:** Problems where vehicle capacity utilization is critical (e.g., average demand > 50% of vehicle capacity).  \n- **Sparse Network:** Problems with a low density of nodes near the depot (e.g., average distance from depot > threshold).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **minimizing the insertion cost** is the primary goal.  \n- Performs well for instances with **dense clusters of nodes**.  \n- Effective when problem instances have **homogeneous demand** across nodes.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Cluster Density:** Problems with a high density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance < threshold).  \n- **Demand Homogeneity:** Standard deviation of demand across nodes is low (e.g., std(demand) < threshold).  \n- **Depot-Centric:** Problems where most nodes are close to the depot.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where the goal is to **quickly construct feasible routes** by prioritizing nearby nodes.  \n- Performs well in **small-to-medium-sized instances** where computational efficiency is important.  \n- Effective in instances with **low remaining node count** and where applying local optimization (e.g., 2-opt) is beneficial.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Problem Size:** Small to medium-sized instances (e.g., node count < 200).  \n- **Proximity Dominance:** Problems where nearby nodes are dominant (e.g., average distance between nodes < threshold).  \n- **Computation-Constrained:** When computational efficiency is a priority.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **merging routes** can result in significant cost savings.  \n- Performs well for instances with **moderate-to-high node density** and **relatively homogeneous demand**.  \n- The merge threshold parameter can be tuned to handle **varied capacity constraints**.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Route Merge Potential:** Problems with high savings potential (e.g., total savings from merging > threshold).  \n- **Moderate Node Density:** Problems with moderate density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance is within a certain range).  \n- **Capacity Utilization:** When vehicle capacity utilization is flexible and not near its maximum limit.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **fine-tuned route optimization** is necessary after an initial solution is constructed.  \n- Useful for **highly constrained problems** where minor changes can result in significant cost improvements.  \n- Effective in instances with **non-trivial overlaps between routes**.  \n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Initial Solution Quality:** When initial solutions are suboptimal (e.g., cost > threshold).  \n- **Route Intersections:** High overlap in routes (e.g., number of shared nodes between routes > threshold).  \n- **Demand Complexity:** Problems with complex demand patterns across nodes.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems requiring **route simplification and compactness**.  \n- Useful as a **local optimization heuristic** to improve routes generated by other algorithms.  \n- Performs well for **medium-sized instances** with relatively **short routes**.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Route Length:** Problems where the average route length is moderate (e.g., number of nodes per route < threshold).  \n- **Initial Solution Quality:** Effective when initial solutions are moderately close to optimal (e.g., cost within 10-20% of known lower bound).  \n- **Node Clustering:** When nodes are clustered but not optimally connected.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table:\n\n| **Heuristic**            | **Best Scenarios**

Given the high number of unvisited nodes (199) and the need for an initial feasible solution, the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for this stage. Its ability to prioritize nearby nodes with higher demands while maintaining computational efficiency makes it ideal for constructing an initial foundation.

The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the initial stage, as evidenced by the significant reduction in unvisited nodes and the fulfillment of 198 units of demand. Given the high number of remaining unvisited nodes and the heuristic's focus on computational efficiency and demand prioritization, running it for another 10 steps will help further construct the solution.

The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has shown consistent performance in the first two rounds by efficiently reducing unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand while maintaining a reasonable cost increase.

Despite being partially constructed with 51 nodes visited and 149 unvisited, the heuristic remains computationally efficient and suitable for this phase. Its ability to prioritize nearby nodes with higher demands ensures that the foundation of the solution is robust for further refinement.

Given the heuristic's computational efficiency and ability to handle the current stage of the problem effectively, it remains the most suitable choice.

However, the current solution now has 101 visited nodes and is partially constructed with significant room for improvement in route compactness and cost optimization. The standard deviation of route lengths (6.36) and current cost (591.0) indicate that the solution can benefit from refinement. The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it allows fine-tuned optimization of routes by removing overlaps and reducing unnecessary detours. This is especially useful now that the solution has reached a more mature phase where local optimization is critical for cost improvement.

However, the high standard deviation of route lengths (6.36) and the significant number of unvisited nodes (99) indicate that the solution can still benefit from further refinement. The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has shown potential in reducing overlaps and enhancing route compactness in the previous round, as evidenced by the 10.0 reduction in cost. Running it for another 10 steps is appropriate to continue improving route efficiency and overall solution quality, especially since no significant gains are expected from further construction at this stage.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a mature stage, with 101 visited nodes and a partially optimized cost of 581.0.

The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic demonstrated its effectiveness in the previous round by reducing the total cost by 10.0.

The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it focuses on improving route compactness and reducing overlaps, which are critical for fine-tuning the solution.

While the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has not shown recent improvements in cost or fulfilled demands, its focus on route compactness and overlap reduction remains relevant. Given the lack of cost improvement over the last few rounds, running another 10 steps will help evaluate whether diminishing returns have been fully reached or if further refinement is still achievable.

Given that the solution is nearing completion with only 9 unvisited nodes and the focus now shifting to fine-tuning and compactness, `three_opt_e8d7` is a more suitable choice. It is designed for more aggressive local optimization compared to `two_opt_0554` and has the potential to further refine the solution by addressing route overlaps and inefficiencies. Running it for 10 steps will help evaluate whether additional cost reductions and improvements in route compactness are achievable.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 7.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 31---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The recent performance of `two_opt_0554` has shown diminishing returns, with minimal cost reductions in the last two rounds (-31.0 and -3.0). While `three_opt_e8d7` showed a slight increase in cost (+7.0), it remains a more aggressive local optimization heuristic, better suited for addressing inefficiencies and overlaps in routes. Given the maturity of the solution (only 9 unvisited nodes and a valid solution), running `three_opt_e8d7` for another 10 steps will help evaluate whether further refinements are achievable or if diminishing returns have been reached.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 6.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 32---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a mature phase with only 9 unvisited nodes, and the focus is on fine-tuning and cost optimization. While the last two rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` resulted in minor cost increases (+7.0 and +6.0), this heuristic remains the most aggressive local optimization method. Given the diminishing returns observed with `two_opt_0554` in earlier rounds, it is worth running `three_opt_e8d7` for another 10 steps to evaluate whether further refinements in route compactness and cost reduction are achievable. If no improvement is observed in this round, we can consider stopping or exploring other heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -15.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 33---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The solution is in a mature phase with only 9 unvisited nodes and a valid state. The recent round of `three_opt_e8d7` showed a cost reduction of -15.0, indicating that the heuristic is still effective in fine-tuning and reducing route inefficiencies. Given the diminishing returns seen with `two_opt_0554` earlier and the positive impact of `three_opt_e8d7` in the last round, it is appropriate to continue with this heuristic for another 10 steps to further refine route compactness and reduce costs. If no further cost improvement is observed after this round, we can consider stopping or exploring other heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 34---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The recent performance of `three_opt_e8d7` has demonstrated its capability for fine-tuning and reducing route inefficiencies, as evidenced by the cost reduction of -15.0 in Round 32. While Round 33 did not show any further cost improvement, diminishing returns have not yet been conclusively reached, and the solution is still in a mature stage with only 9 unvisited nodes. Running another 10 steps will help confirm whether further refinements in route compactness and cost optimization are achievable or if the heuristic has reached its limit. If no improvement is observed after this round, we may consider stopping or switching to another heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 35---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a mature phase with only 9 unvisited nodes and valid state data. While recent rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown mixed performance, with a significant cost reduction of -15.0 in Round 32 and no further improvement in the last two rounds, the heuristic remains the most aggressive and suitable for fine-tuning route compactness and reducing inefficiencies. Given that diminishing returns have not been conclusively reached, running another 10 steps with `three_opt_e8d7` will confirm whether further refinements are achievable. If no improvement is observed after this round, we should consider stopping or exploring other heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 36---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a mature phase with only 9 unvisited nodes, and the solution is valid. While recent rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown limited improvements, the cost reduction of -15.0 in Round 32 indicates that the heuristic still has potential for refining route compactness and reducing inefficiencies. Given that diminishing returns have not been definitively reached, running another 10 steps will help confirm whether further refinements are achievable or if the heuristic has reached its effectiveness limit. If no improvement is observed, we can then consider stopping or switching to a different heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 37---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution is in a mature phase with only 9 unvisited nodes and a valid state. While recent rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have shown limited progress, the cost reduction of -15.0 in Round 32 indicates that the heuristic still has the potential to refine route compactness and address inefficiencies. Given that diminishing returns have not been definitively reached and `three_opt_e8d7` is more aggressive than `two_opt_0554`, running it for another 10 steps is appropriate to further test its effectiveness. If no improvement is observed after this round, we should consider stopping or switching to another heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
