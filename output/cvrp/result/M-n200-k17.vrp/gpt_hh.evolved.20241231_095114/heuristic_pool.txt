I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

***is_cop:yes*** 

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP), as it involves finding the optimal combination of routes under specific constraints such as vehicle capacity, minimizing total distance or cost. Your solution, operator framework, and heuristic function signature align well with solving such problems using heuristics.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each of your implemented heuristics is most applicable. Each heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary depending on the problem characteristics. Below is a breakdown of when to use each heuristic and how the scenarios can be quantified:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems with **highly dispersed nodes** where the goal is to create balanced routes across vehicles.
- Particularly effective when the focus is on **maximizing route compactness** and **utilizing vehicle capacity efficiently**.  
- Works well for instances where the distance matrix is sparse or the depot is far from most nodes.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Node Dispersion:** High variance in the distance matrix (e.g., variance > threshold).  
- **Capacity Utilization:** Problems where vehicle capacity utilization is critical (e.g., average demand > 50% of vehicle capacity).  
- **Sparse Network:** Problems with a low density of nodes near the depot (e.g., average distance from depot > threshold).  

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **minimizing the insertion cost** is the primary goal.  
- Performs well for instances with **dense clusters of nodes**.  
- Effective when problem instances have **homogeneous demand** across nodes.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Cluster Density:** Problems with a high density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance < threshold).  
- **Demand Homogeneity:** Standard deviation of demand across nodes is low (e.g., std(demand) < threshold).  
- **Depot-Centric:** Problems where most nodes are close to the depot.  

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where the goal is to **quickly construct feasible routes** by prioritizing nearby nodes.  
- Performs well in **small-to-medium-sized instances** where computational efficiency is important.  
- Effective in instances with **low remaining node count** and where applying local optimization (e.g., 2-opt) is beneficial.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Problem Size:** Small to medium-sized instances (e.g., node count < 200).  
- **Proximity Dominance:** Problems where nearby nodes are dominant (e.g., average distance between nodes < threshold).  
- **Computation-Constrained:** When computational efficiency is a priority.  

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **merging routes** can result in significant cost savings.  
- Performs well for instances with **moderate-to-high node density** and **relatively homogeneous demand**.  
- The merge threshold parameter can be tuned to handle **varied capacity constraints**.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Route Merge Potential:** Problems with high savings potential (e.g., total savings from merging > threshold).  
- **Moderate Node Density:** Problems with moderate density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance is within a certain range).  
- **Capacity Utilization:** When vehicle capacity utilization is flexible and not near its maximum limit.  

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **fine-tuned route optimization** is necessary after an initial solution is constructed.  
- Useful for **highly constrained problems** where minor changes can result in significant cost improvements.  
- Effective in instances with **non-trivial overlaps between routes**.  

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Initial Solution Quality:** When initial solutions are suboptimal (e.g., cost > threshold).  
- **Route Intersections:** High overlap in routes (e.g., number of shared nodes between routes > threshold).  
- **Demand Complexity:** Problems with complex demand patterns across nodes.  

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems requiring **route simplification and compactness**.  
- Useful as a **local optimization heuristic** to improve routes generated by other algorithms.  
- Performs well for **medium-sized instances** with relatively **short routes**.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Route Length:** Problems where the average route length is moderate (e.g., number of nodes per route < threshold).  
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Effective when initial solutions are moderately close to optimal (e.g., cost within 10-20% of known lower bound).  
- **Node Clustering:** When nodes are clustered but not optimally connected.

This analysis provides a structured way to assess which heuristic is most applicable to a given CVRP instance. By quantifying problem characteristics such as node density, demand patterns, and initial solution quality, you can determine the best heuristic to apply.
