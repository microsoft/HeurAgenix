Each heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary depending on the problem characteristics. Below is a breakdown of when to use each heuristic and how the scenarios can be quantified:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems with **highly dispersed nodes** where the goal is to create balanced routes across vehicles.\n- Particularly effective when the focus is on **maximizing route compactness** and **utilizing vehicle capacity efficiently**.  \n- Works well for instances where the distance matrix is sparse or the depot is far from most nodes.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Node Dispersion:** High variance in the distance matrix (e.g., variance > threshold).  \n- **Capacity Utilization:** Problems where vehicle capacity utilization is critical (e.g., average demand > 50% of vehicle capacity).  \n- **Sparse Network:** Problems with a low density of nodes near the depot (e.g., average distance from depot > threshold).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **minimizing the insertion cost** is the primary goal.  \n- Performs well for instances with **dense clusters of nodes**.  \n- Effective when problem instances have **homogeneous demand** across nodes.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Cluster Density:** Problems with a high density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance < threshold).  \n- **Demand Homogeneity:** Standard deviation of demand across nodes is low (e.g., std(demand) < threshold).  \n- **Depot-Centric:** Problems where most nodes are close to the depot.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where the goal is to **quickly construct feasible routes** by prioritizing nearby nodes.  \n- Performs well in **small-to-medium-sized instances** where computational efficiency is important.  \n- Effective in instances with **low remaining node count** and where applying local optimization (e.g., 2-opt) is beneficial.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Problem Size:** Small to medium-sized instances (e.g., node count < 200).  \n- **Proximity Dominance:** Problems where nearby nodes are dominant (e.g., average distance between nodes < threshold).  \n- **Computation-Constrained:** When computational efficiency is a priority.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **merging routes** can result in significant cost savings.  \n- Performs well for instances with **moderate-to-high node density** and **relatively homogeneous demand**.  \n- The merge threshold parameter can be tuned to handle **varied capacity constraints**.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Route Merge Potential:** Problems with high savings potential (e.g., total savings from merging > threshold).  \n- **Moderate Node Density:** Problems with moderate density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance is within a certain range).  \n- **Capacity Utilization:** When vehicle capacity utilization is flexible and not near its maximum limit.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems where **fine-tuned route optimization** is necessary after an initial solution is constructed.  \n- Useful for **highly constrained problems** where minor changes can result in significant cost improvements.  \n- Effective in instances with **non-trivial overlaps between routes**.  \n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Initial Solution Quality:** When initial solutions are suboptimal (e.g., cost > threshold).  \n- **Route Intersections:** High overlap in routes (e.g., number of shared nodes between routes > threshold).  \n- **Demand Complexity:** Problems with complex demand patterns across nodes.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**  \n**Scenario:**  \n- Best for problems requiring **route simplification and compactness**.  \n- Useful as a **local optimization heuristic** to improve routes generated by other algorithms.  \n- Performs well for **medium-sized instances** with relatively **short routes**.\n\n**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  \n- **Route Length:** Problems where the average route length is moderate (e.g., number of nodes per route < threshold).  \n- **Initial Solution Quality:** Effective when initial solutions are moderately close to optimal (e.g., cost within 10-20% of known lower bound).  \n- **Node Clustering:** When nodes are clustered but not optimally connected.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table:\n\n| **Heuristic**            | **Best Scenarios**
