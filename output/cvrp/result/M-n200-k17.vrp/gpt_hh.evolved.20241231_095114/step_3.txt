I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):

        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

***is_cop:yes*** 

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP), as it involves finding the optimal combination of routes under specific constraints such as vehicle capacity, minimizing total distance or cost. Your solution, operator framework, and heuristic function signature align well with solving such problems using heuristics.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each of your implemented heuristics is most applicable. Each heuristic has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary depending on the problem characteristics. Below is a breakdown of when to use each heuristic and how the scenarios can be quantified:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems with **highly dispersed nodes** where the goal is to create balanced routes across vehicles.
- Particularly effective when the focus is on **maximizing route compactness** and **utilizing vehicle capacity efficiently**.  
- Works well for instances where the distance matrix is sparse or the depot is far from most nodes.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Node Dispersion:** High variance in the distance matrix (e.g., variance > threshold).  
- **Capacity Utilization:** Problems where vehicle capacity utilization is critical (e.g., average demand > 50% of vehicle capacity).  
- **Sparse Network:** Problems with a low density of nodes near the depot (e.g., average distance from depot > threshold).  

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **minimizing the insertion cost** is the primary goal.  
- Performs well for instances with **dense clusters of nodes**.  
- Effective when problem instances have **homogeneous demand** across nodes.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Cluster Density:** Problems with a high density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance < threshold).  
- **Demand Homogeneity:** Standard deviation of demand across nodes is low (e.g., std(demand) < threshold).  
- **Depot-Centric:** Problems where most nodes are close to the depot.  

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where the goal is to **quickly construct feasible routes** by prioritizing nearby nodes.  
- Performs well in **small-to-medium-sized instances** where computational efficiency is important.  
- Effective in instances with **low remaining node count** and where applying local optimization (e.g., 2-opt) is beneficial.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Problem Size:** Small to medium-sized instances (e.g., node count < 200).  
- **Proximity Dominance:** Problems where nearby nodes are dominant (e.g., average distance between nodes < threshold).  
- **Computation-Constrained:** When computational efficiency is a priority.  

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **merging routes** can result in significant cost savings.  
- Performs well for instances with **moderate-to-high node density** and **relatively homogeneous demand**.  
- The merge threshold parameter can be tuned to handle **varied capacity constraints**.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Route Merge Potential:** Problems with high savings potential (e.g., total savings from merging > threshold).  
- **Moderate Node Density:** Problems with moderate density of nodes (e.g., average inter-node distance is within a certain range).  
- **Capacity Utilization:** When vehicle capacity utilization is flexible and not near its maximum limit.  

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems where **fine-tuned route optimization** is necessary after an initial solution is constructed.  
- Useful for **highly constrained problems** where minor changes can result in significant cost improvements.  
- Effective in instances with **non-trivial overlaps between routes**.  

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Initial Solution Quality:** When initial solutions are suboptimal (e.g., cost > threshold).  
- **Route Intersections:** High overlap in routes (e.g., number of shared nodes between routes > threshold).  
- **Demand Complexity:** Problems with complex demand patterns across nodes.  

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**  
**Scenario:**  
- Best for problems requiring **route simplification and compactness**.  
- Useful as a **local optimization heuristic** to improve routes generated by other algorithms.  
- Performs well for **medium-sized instances** with relatively **short routes**.

**Quantifiable Scenarios:**  
- **Route Length:** Problems where the average route length is moderate (e.g., number of nodes per route < threshold).  
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Effective when initial solutions are moderately close to optimal (e.g., cost within 10-20% of known lower bound).  
- **Node Clustering:** When nodes are clustered but not optimally connected.

This analysis provides a structured way to assess which heuristic is most applicable to a given CVRP instance. By quantifying problem characteristics such as node density, demand patterns, and initial solution quality, you can determine the best heuristic to apply.

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution is entirely unconstructed (all vehicles are at the depot, and no nodes have been visited). Given the high number of unvisited nodes (199) and the need for an initial feasible solution, the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for this stage. Its ability to prioritize nearby nodes with higher demands while maintaining computational efficiency makes it ideal for constructing an initial foundation. After 10 steps, we can assess the quality of the partially constructed solution and determine whether to continue with this heuristic or switch to another.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 47.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 198
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution is partially constructed, with only one vehicle serving 11 nodes and 189 nodes still unvisited. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the initial stage, as evidenced by the significant reduction in unvisited nodes and the fulfillment of 198 units of demand. Given the high number of remaining unvisited nodes and the heuristic's focus on computational efficiency and demand prioritization, running it for another 10 steps will help further construct the solution. This will provide a clearer foundation for subsequent refinement or optimization heuristics.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 42.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 164
---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution remains partially constructed, with only 21 nodes visited and 179 nodes unvisited. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has shown consistent performance in the first two rounds by efficiently reducing unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand while maintaining a reasonable cost increase. Given the high number of unvisited nodes and the heuristic's computational efficiency in this stage, running it for another 10 steps is appropriate to further construct the solution and lay a stronger foundation for later refinement or optimization.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 50.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 148

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9  
running steps: 10  
hype parameter(optional): None  
explanation: The current solution is still partially constructed, with only 31 nodes visited and 169 nodes remaining unvisited. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has demonstrated consistent performance in reducing unvisited nodes and fulfilling demand over the past three rounds, while maintaining computational efficiency. Given the high number of remaining unvisited nodes and the heuristic's ability to construct feasible routes quickly, running it for another 10 steps is appropriate to further expand the solution. This will help establish a more robust initial solution before transitioning to refinement or optimization heuristics.
