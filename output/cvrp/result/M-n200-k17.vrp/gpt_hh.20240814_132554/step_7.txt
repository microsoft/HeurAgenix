I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely! Let's analyze the scenarios where each of these heuristic algorithms is most applicable and how they can be best quantified:

### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**

**Scenario:**
- Best suited for refining an already good solution.
- Useful when the initial solution is close to optimal but requires local improvements.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the initial solution has high total travel distance.
- Apply when the solution structure is complex, and small local changes can lead to significant improvements.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**

**Scenario:**
- Effective for escaping local optima.
- Suitable for problems where multiple local search methods can be combined to explore the solution space.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the solution space is large and has multiple local optima.
- Apply when there is a need for a more robust search that adapts to different neighborhood structures.

### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**

**Scenario:**
- Best for making significant changes to the route structure.
- Suitable for improving solutions that are stuck in local optima.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the current solution has suboptimal routes with potential for large improvements.
- Apply when the distance matrix suggests significant gains from reordering multiple nodes.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**

**Scenario:**
- Ideal for generating initial solutions quickly.
- Suitable for problems where a fast approximation is needed.

**Quantification:**
- Use when starting with no initial solution.
- Apply when computational resources are limited, and a quick solution is necessary.

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)**

**Scenario:**
- Good for constructing initial solutions that can be further refined.
- Suitable for problems where a straightforward approach can provide a reasonable starting point.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the problem size is manageable, and a simple heuristic can yield a decent solution.
- Apply when the distances are such that nearest nodes are likely to be part of the optimal solution.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**

**Scenario:**
- Effective for combining routes to reduce the total distance.
- Suitable for problems where merging routes can lead to significant savings in travel distance.

**Quantification:**
- Use when there are many short routes that can be merged into fewer, longer routes.
- Apply when the distance matrix shows potential savings from route consolidation.

### 7. **Random Heuristic (`random_bfdc`)**

**Scenario:**
- Useful for generating diverse initial solutions.
- Suitable for problems where random exploration can provide new insights.

**Quantification:**
- Use when there is no prior information about the problem structure.
- Apply when generating multiple diverse solutions is beneficial for exploration.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**

**Scenario:**
- Best for constructing routes that are loops around the depot.
- Suitable for problems with a central depot and evenly distributed nodes.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the depot is centrally located, and nodes are distributed in a circular pattern around it.
- Apply when the problem structure favors loop-based routes.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**

**Scenario:**
- Effective for problems where distant nodes need to be incorporated early.
- Suitable for problems where inserting the farthest nodes first can lead to better solutions.

**Quantification:**
- Use when there are outliers or distant nodes that need to be included in the solution.
- Apply when the distance matrix shows significant variation in node distances.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**

**Scenario:**
- Best for balancing load and improving route efficiency.
- Suitable for problems where moving nodes between routes can reduce total distance or improve load balance.

**Quantification:**
- Use when current routes are unbalanced in terms of load or distance.
- Apply when there are clear opportunities for shifting nodes to improve the solution.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**

**Scenario:**
- Effective for inserting nodes in a way that minimizes additional cost.
- Suitable for problems where incremental improvements are needed.

**Quantification:**
- Use when the current solution has gaps or opportunities for low-cost insertions.
- Apply when the distance matrix suggests small incremental gains from node insertions.

By understanding the scenarios and quantifying when each heuristic is most applicable, you can better select and apply the appropriate algorithm to solve the CVRP efficiently.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: min_cost_insertion_7bfa. How does min_cost_insertion_7bfa perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Based on the current state of your CVRP solution and the historical performance of the heuristics applied so far, hereâs an analysis to guide the next steps:

### Current State Overview:
- **Visited Nodes:** 71 out of 200
- **Unvisited Nodes:** 129
- **Fulfilled Demands:** 1067
- **Remaining Demands:** 2119
- **Total Current Cost:** 502.0
- **Vehicle Utilization:** 6 out of 17 vehicles in use

### Analysis:

1. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)** was the last heuristic applied. It is effective for strategically inserting unvisited nodes into the current routes, minimizing the increase in total cost while increasing the number of visited nodes. However, continuing with it may lead to diminishing returns if not complemented by other heuristics.

2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)** has been used multiple times and has been effective in exploring different neighborhoods and refining the solution. It can be a good choice for further refinement but may need to be combined with other heuristics to fully utilize unused vehicles.

3. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)** was used but did not result in changes, possibly due to the current solution structure. It may be worth revisiting after further improvements.

4. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)** and **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)** were effective in constructing the initial solution but may not provide significant improvements at this stage.

### Recommendation:
Given the current state, a combination of heuristics that can strategically insert unvisited nodes and optimize routes is recommended. Specifically, using **Variable Neighborhood Search** to refine the current solution and **Min-Cost Insertion** to strategically add unvisited nodes.

### Decision:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
running steps: 15
explanation: Variable Neighborhood Search will help in refining the current solution by exploring different neighborhoods and potentially improving both the number of visited nodes and overall cost.
***

Once the results from the Variable Neighborhood Search are available, we can reassess whether to continue with the same heuristic or switch to another, such as Min-Cost Insertion, to further improve the solution.
