The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

Running this for 10 steps will provide a good starting point for further refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 43.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 160\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_99ba. How does nearest_neighbor_99ba perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

However, this is a greedy approach and may not always provide the best long-term solution.\n\nTo further develop the solution, we can consider applying a different heuristic that can help in refining the existing routes, balancing loads, or exploring new parts of the solution space.\n\n### Decision Options:\n1. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`):**\n   - **Pros:** Can systematically change the neighborhood structure to escape local optima and search for better solutions.\n   - **Cons:** May require more computational effort, but can provide significant improvements.\n   \n2. **Two-Opt (`two_opt_0554`):**\n   - **Pros:** Good for refining the current solution by making local improvements.\n   - **Cons:** May not explore new areas of the solution space.\n\n3. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`):**\n   - **Pros:** Can construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route.\n   - **Cons:** May be similar to the nearest neighbor heuristic in terms of its greedy nature.\n\n4. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`):**\n   - **Pros:** Effective for combining routes to reduce total distance.\n   - **Cons:** Requires careful consideration of merge thresholds and capacity constraints.\n\n### Recommended Next Step:\nGiven the current state and the need to balance route refinement and exploration of new solutions, I recommend using **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**. This heuristic can systematically explore different neighborhoods and potentially provide significant improvements.\n\n### Decision:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nrunning steps: 10\nhyper parameter(optional): None\nexplanation: Variable Neighborhood Search can help escape local optima and explore different neighborhoods, providing a balanced approach to refining the current solution and exploring new parts of the solution space.\n***\n\nThis approach will allow us to systematically explore and improve the current solution while considering different neighborhood structures. Let's run this for 10 steps and review the performance."
