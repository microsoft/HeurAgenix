I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""

        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations, subject to various constraints, such as vehicle capacity. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve CVRP due to its NP-hard nature, making exact solutions computationally infeasible for larger instances. The framework you have described for handling solutions and operators supports the application of heuristic algorithms, which is appropriate for this type of problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,metaheuristics,route_merging,node_relocation

construction_heuristics: These algorithms focus on building an initial feasible solution by adding nodes to routes in an efficient manner.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

improvement_heuristics: These algorithms focus on improving an existing solution by making local changes, such as swapping or reordering nodes within routes.
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

metaheuristics: This approach uses multiple neighborhood structures to escape local optima and explore a larger solution space.
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

route_merging: This approach focuses on combining routes to reduce the overall distance or cost, leveraging savings in merging routes.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.

node_relocation: This focuses on relocating nodes between routes to improve balance or reduce costs, considering capacity constraints.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:200
vehicle_num:17
capacity:200
depot:0
demands:[0, 10, 7, 13, 19, 26, 3, 5, 9, 16, 16, 12, 19, 23, 20, 8, 19, 2, 12, 17, 9, 11, 18, 29, 3, 6, 17, 16, 16, 9, 21, 27, 23, 11, 14, 8, 5, 8, 16, 31, 9, 5, 5, 7, 18, 16, 1, 27, 36, 30, 13, 10, 9, 14, 18, 2, 6, 7, 18, 28, 3, 13, 19, 10, 9, 20, 25, 25, 36, 6, 5, 15, 25, 9, 8, 18, 13, 14, 3, 23, 6, 26, 16, 11, 7, 41, 35, 26, 9, 15, 3, 1, 2, 22, 27, 20, 11, 12, 10, 9, 17, 7, 30, 16, 9, 21, 15, 19, 23, 11, 5, 19, 29, 23, 21, 10, 15, 3, 41, 9, 28, 8, 8, 16, 10, 28, 7, 15, 14, 6, 19, 11, 12, 23, 26, 17, 6, 9, 15, 14, 7, 27, 13, 11, 16, 10, 5, 25, 17, 18, 10, 18, 26, 11, 30, 21, 19, 15, 16, 29, 26, 37, 16, 12, 31, 8, 19, 20, 13, 15, 22, 28, 12, 6, 27, 14, 18, 17, 29, 13, 22, 25, 28, 27, 19, 10, 12, 14, 24, 16, 33, 15, 11, 18, 17, 21, 27, 19, 20, 5]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 5 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is crucial for optimizing the solution process. Here's a framework that can help guide your decisions:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Construction
1. **Objective**: Build an initial feasible solution quickly and efficiently.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Construction Heuristics**: Start by experimenting with different construction heuristics to create an initial solution. Utilize:
     - `farthest_insertion_6308` for diverse node selection.
     - `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` for cost-efficient route building.
     - `nearest_neighbor_54a9` when prioritizing higher demands.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Run each heuristic briefly on a subset of the problem.
     - Evaluate solution quality and computational effort.
     - Record performance metrics for comparison.
     - Select the heuristic that provides a feasible solution with good initial quality and low computational time.

#### Phase 2: Initial Improvement
1. **Objective**: Enhance the initial solution by making local changes.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Improvement Heuristics**: Focus on refining the initial solution using:
     - `two_opt_0554` for route compactness.
     - `three_opt_e8d7` for more extensive local optimizations.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Apply selected heuristics iteratively to the initial solution.
     - Monitor solution improvements and convergence rate.
     - Adjust parameters if necessary to explore different local improvements.

#### Phase 3: Exploration and Diversification
1. **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore a larger solution space.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Metaheuristics**:
     - `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` for systematic neighborhood changes.
   - **Node Relocation**:
     - `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` for balancing loads and reducing costs.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Implement metaheuristics to explore alternative solutions.
     - Use node relocation to fine-tune vehicle loads and costs.
     - Alternate between metaheuristics and node relocation to diversify the search space.

#### Phase 4: Route Merging and Final Optimization
1. **Objective**: Optimize the overall solution by merging routes and fine-tuning.
2. **Heuristic Categories**:
   - **Route Merging**:
     - `saving_algorithm_710e` to combine routes with significant savings.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - Evaluate the potential for route merging with the saving algorithm.
     - Apply final optimizations to ensure route efficiency and capacity compliance.
     - Validate the solution to ensure all constraints are met.

### Iterative Approach
- **Evaluation and Feedback**: After each phase, assess the performance of the heuristics used and gather insights on what worked well.
- **Adaptation**: Be prepared to adapt the strategy based on the problem's characteristics and the performance metrics.
- **Experimentation**: Encourage experimentation with different combinations of heuristics in each phase to identify the most effective strategies.

This guide provides a structured approach to selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for the CVRP. By iteratively alternating between different heuristics and evaluating their effectiveness, you can optimize the problem-solving process and achieve better solutions.

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The current solution has just been initialized with no nodes visited except the depot. Therefore, it is crucial to first construct a feasible initial solution by assigning nodes to routes. Using construction heuristics will help quickly build an initial feasible solution. This will provide a foundation to further refine and improve upon in subsequent phases.
Visited Node Num: 1->6
Current Cost: 0.0->37.0
Fulfilled Demands: 0->83
---Round 1---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The initial solution is still in its early stages, with only a small number of nodes visited and a significant number of nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will allow us to further build upon the current solution, ensuring more nodes are assigned to routes and improving the foundation. This phase is crucial before shifting to other heuristics to refine and optimize the routes.
Visited Node Num: 6->11
Current Cost: 37.0->53.0
Fulfilled Demands: 83->184
---Round 2---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The current solution is still in its early stages, with a significant number of nodes unvisited and only one vehicle partially utilized. Continuing with construction heuristics will help in further developing the solution by assigning more nodes to routes, thereby building a stronger foundation. This approach ensures that all nodes are incorporated into the solution efficiently before moving to improvement heuristics. Once a more comprehensive initial solution is established, transitioning to other categories like improvement or metaheuristics can be more effective for refining and optimizing the routes.
Visited Node Num: 11->16
Current Cost: 53.0->87.0
Fulfilled Demands: 184->274
---Round 3---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The current solution is in its early stages, with only 16 nodes visited out of 200 and a significant number of unvisited nodes remaining. Continuing with construction heuristics will allow us to further develop the solution by assigning more nodes to routes and ensuring all nodes are incorporated efficiently. This phase is crucial for building a more comprehensive initial solution before transitioning to other categories like improvement or metaheuristics for refining and optimizing the routes.
Visited Node Num: 16->21
Current Cost: 87.0->111.0
Fulfilled Demands: 274->362
---Round 4---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The current solution has established a base with 21 nodes visited, but there remains a significant number of unvisited nodes and ample remaining vehicle capacity. Switching to improvement heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, will help refine the existing routes by reducing costs and potentially optimizing the vehicle loads. This approach focuses on enhancing the initial solution's quality before continuing to assign unvisited nodes, ensuring the routes are more efficient and compact.
Visited Node Num: 21->26
Current Cost: 111.0->154.0
Fulfilled Demands: 362->419
---Round 5---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The current solution has made progress with 26 nodes visited and a total cost of 154.0, but there are still 174 unvisited nodes and significant capacity left in most vehicles. Continuing with improvement heuristics will allow for further refinement of the existing routes by optimizing the visited nodes and potentially reducing costs. This will ensure that the solution is more efficient before attempting to incorporate the remaining unvisited nodes. Improvement heuristics can help balance vehicle loads and improve route compactness, making the solution more robust before transitioning to other heuristic categories.
Visited Node Num: 26->26
Current Cost: 154.0->154.0
Fulfilled Demands: 419->419
---Round 6---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The current solution still has a large number of unvisited nodes (174 out of 200), which indicates that the solution is far from complete. Although some progress has been made with the improvement heuristics, the focus should now return to constructing a more comprehensive initial solution. By revisiting construction heuristics, we can efficiently assign more nodes to routes, thus expanding the foundation upon which further improvements can be built. This approach will ensure that all nodes are incorporated into the solution, providing a better basis for subsequent refinement and optimization phases.

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: farthest_insertion_6308(construction_heuristics). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,metaheuristics,route_merging,node_relocation

The response format is very important.
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx(construction_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,metaheuristics,route_merging,node_relocation)
explanation:xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

explanation: The current solution still has a large number of unvisited nodes (171 out of 200), indicating that the solution is far from complete. While some progress has been made, the foundation is not yet comprehensive enough to support efficient refinement through improvement or other heuristic categories. Continuing with construction heuristics will help in efficiently assigning more nodes to routes, thus expanding the foundation for future improvements. This approach will ensure that the solution incorporates more unvisited nodes, providing a better basis for subsequent refinement and optimization phases.
