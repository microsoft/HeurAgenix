This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\n\nimprovement_heuristics: These algorithms focus on improving an existing solution by making local changes, such as swapping or reordering nodes within routes.\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP.

Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\nnode_relocation: This focuses on relocating nodes between routes to improve balance or reduce costs, considering capacity constraints.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance.

Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 5 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

By focusing on construction heuristics, we can ensure that more nodes are incorporated into the solution, providing a better basis for subsequent improvement and optimization phases.\nVisited Node Num: 152->154\nCurrent Cost: 956.0->968.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2362->2384\n---Round 43---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has made substantial progress, with 154 nodes visited and a significant portion of demand fulfilled. However, there are still 46 unvisited nodes and a considerable remaining demand. Given that most of the utilized vehicles are near capacity, it is an opportune moment to refine and optimize the existing routes before adding more nodes. Improvement heuristics can help enhance route compactness, reduce costs, and balance vehicle loads. By focusing on refining the current solution, we can create a more efficient and robust foundation for incorporating the remaining unvisited nodes in future phases.\nVisited Node Num: 154->159\nCurrent Cost: 968.0->1040.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2384->2488\n---Round 44---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has 41 unvisited nodes with a significant remaining demand of 698, and there is still available vehicle capacity. Returning to construction heuristics will allow us to efficiently assign the remaining unvisited nodes to routes, thus expanding the foundation of the solution. This phase is crucial to ensure that all nodes are incorporated into the solution, providing a better basis for subsequent refinement and optimization phases. By focusing on construction heuristics, we can reduce the number of unvisited nodes and better utilize the available vehicle capacity before applying further improvement or optimization strategies.\nVisited Node Num: 159->164\nCurrent Cost: 1040.0->1061.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2488->2552\n---Round 45---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has visited 164 nodes, leaving 36 unvisited nodes with a remaining demand of 634. While construction heuristics have been effective in expanding the solution, the vehicle loads are near capacity for most utilized vehicles, suggesting that further optimization of existing routes could improve efficiency before incorporating more nodes. Switching to improvement heuristics will help refine route compactness, reduce costs, and balance vehicle loads. This will create a more efficient and robust foundation for incorporating the remaining unvisited nodes in future phases.\nVisited Node Num: 164->169\nCurrent Cost: 1061.0->1172.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2552->2636\n---Round 46---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  Although significant progress has been made with 169 nodes visited, there are still 31 unvisited nodes with a total remaining demand of 550. The vehicle loads are near capacity, but there are some vehicles with remaining capacity that can potentially accommodate additional nodes. Returning to construction heuristics will allow us to efficiently assign these unvisited nodes to routes, thereby expanding the foundation of the solution and reducing the total remaining demand. This approach will ensure that the solution is more comprehensive before applying further refinement or optimization strategies.\nVisited Node Num: 169->174\nCurrent Cost: 1172.0->1214.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2636->2737\n---Round 47---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  With 174 nodes visited and only 26 unvisited nodes remaining, the current solution is nearing completion. However, vehicle loads are close to capacity, and the total cost is relatively high at 1214.0. Before incorporating the remaining unvisited nodes, it's beneficial to refine and optimize the existing routes to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Improvement heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, can help enhance route compactness and balance vehicle loads, making the solution more robust. This will provide a stronger foundation for incorporating the remaining nodes and achieving a more efficient overall solution.\nVisited Node Num: 174->174\nCurrent Cost: 1214.0->1204.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2737->2737\n---Round 48---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Given that there are still 26 unvisited nodes with a total remaining demand of 449, and some vehicles have remaining capacity, it is beneficial to focus on incorporating these unvisited nodes into the solution. Construction heuristics can efficiently assign these nodes to routes, expanding the foundation and making use of available vehicle capacity. This will ensure that the solution becomes more comprehensive, providing a better basis for subsequent refinement and optimization phases. Once the unvisited nodes are reduced, we can switch back to improvement heuristics to further optimize the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 174->175\nCurrent Cost: 1204.0->1154.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2737->2745\n---Round 49---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  With 25 unvisited nodes remaining and most vehicles near capacity, it's crucial to refine and optimize the existing routes to reduce costs and improve efficiency before incorporating more nodes. Improvement heuristics, such as 2-opt, 3-opt, or variable neighborhood search, can help enhance route compactness and balance vehicle loads. This will create a more robust and efficient foundation for addressing the remaining unvisited nodes, ensuring that the solution is optimized before further expansion.\nVisited Node Num: 175->180\nCurrent Cost: 1154.0->1333.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2745->2846\n---Round 50---\nHeuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nHeuristic Category: node_relocation\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has made significant progress, with 180 nodes visited and only 20 nodes remaining unvisited. The vehicle loads are near capacity, and the total cost is relatively high at 1333.0. Node relocation heuristics can help strategically redistribute nodes between routes, potentially balancing loads and reducing costs. This approach allows for better utilization of the available vehicle capacity and can improve overall route efficiency. By focusing on node relocation, we can enhance the current solution's robustness and efficiency, setting a better foundation for incorporating the remaining unvisited nodes in future phases.\nVisited Node Num: 180->180\nCurrent Cost: 1333.0->1235.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2846->2846\n---Round 51---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nHeuristic Category: improvement_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  The current solution has a substantial foundation with 180 nodes visited and only 20 unvisited nodes remaining. The vehicle loads are near capacity, suggesting that the existing routes might benefit from further optimization to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Improvement heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, can help refine route compactness and balance vehicle loads, making the solution more robust. By focusing on improving the current solution, we can ensure the routes are as efficient as possible before incorporating the remaining nodes, providing a stronger basis for final optimization and ensuring better overall performance.\nVisited Node Num: 180->180\nCurrent Cost: 1235.0->1231.0\nFulfilled Demands: 2846->2846\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\nvisited_nodes:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]\nvisited_num:180\nunvisited_nodes:[14, 15, 19, 23, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45, 49, 64, 65, 66, 67, 107, 113, 125, 143, 168, 175]\nunvisited_num:20\ntotal_current_cost:1231.0\nlast_visited:[146, 12, 0, 183, 182, 144, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0]\nvehicle_loads:[192, 200, 180, 197, 187, 200, 198, 190, 196, 200, 200, 200, 196, 195, 115, 0, 0]\nvehicle_remaining_capacity:[8, 0, 20, 3, 13, 0, 2, 10, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 85, 200, 200]\naverage_route_length:11.529411764705882\nmax_route_length:17\nmin_route_length:1\nstd_dev_route_length:4.29935216814626\naverage_route_cost:69.2\ntotal_demand_served:2846\naverage_vehicle_load:167.41176470588235\naverage_remaining_vehicle_capacity:32.588235294117645\nnumber_of_unvisited_nodes:20\naverage_unvisited_node_demand:17.0\ntotal_remaining_demand:340\nsolution_validity:True\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: three_opt_e8d7(improvement_heuristics).
