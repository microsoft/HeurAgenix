I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations, which is a classic example of a problem that can be tackled using heuristic methods. The framework you have outlined, with solutions and operators to manipulate those solutions, is a common approach in heuristic and metaheuristic algorithm design. Your problem definition, solution representation, and operator implementations appear to be aligned with standard practices for solving combinatorial optimization problems like CVRP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is most applicable can be essential for choosing the right approach based on specific problem characteristics. Hereâs an analysis of when each heuristic might be most suitable:

1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful when the problem involves a sparse network or when it's crucial to address the outliers (farther nodes) early in the process to ensure they are efficiently integrated into the routes.
   - **Best Quantified By**: The spatial distribution of nodes, particularly where some nodes are significantly farther from the depot or other nodes.

2. **Greedy Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for problems where computational speed is a priority and an initial solution is needed quickly, potentially as a starting point for further refinement.
   - **Best Quantified By**: The density and proximity of nodes, as the algorithm focuses on short-term gains by choosing the nearest unvisited node.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where minimizing the incremental cost of adding nodes to routes is critical, often providing a good balance between solution quality and computational effort.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Cost-effectiveness of route expansions and the ability to accommodate additional nodes without significant cost increases.

4. **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in dense networks where nearest connections are likely to be part of the optimal route. It's a straightforward approach thatâs easy to implement and understand.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Node density and average distance between nodes, emphasizing short connections.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful for scenarios requiring load balancing across vehicles or when initial routes can be improved by relocating nodes.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Imbalance in route loads or potential benefits from shifting nodes between routes.

6. **Petal Algorithm**: 
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in cases where routes naturally form loops around a central depot. Itâs advantageous when routes can be easily visualized as petals around a central point.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Centralized node distribution with radial route patterns.

7. **Random Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Best used in exploratory phases or when generating diverse initial solutions for metaheuristics like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Situations requiring randomness to escape local optima or to serve as a baseline comparison.

8. **Saving Algorithm**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when there are significant potential savings in merging routes. Itâs often used when vehicle capacity constraints are not the primary limiting factor.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Potential distance or cost savings from merging routes, assessed through savings calculations.

9. **Three-Opt Heuristic**: 
   - **Scenario**: Appropriate for refining solutions where multiple route segments can be improved simultaneously, especially in dense networks.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Potential for significant route improvements through more complex segment swaps.

10. **Two-Opt Heuristic**: 
    - **Scenario**: Suitable for local optimization, where small improvements in route efficiency are possible by swapping two edges.
    - **Best Quantified By**: Solutions close to optimal where small perturbations can yield improvements.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**: 
    - **Scenario**: Best used when solutions are stuck in local optima, as VNS systematically explores different neighborhoods to find better solutions.
    - **Best Quantified By**: The diversity of neighborhood structures and the problemâs susceptibility to different local search strategies.

These heuristics are applicable based on the specific problem characteristics, computational resources, and the desired balance between solution quality and processing time.

---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the initial state of the solution where no nodes have been visited and all vehicles have full capacity, the Nearest Neighbor heuristic is a suitable choice. It will quickly construct initial routes by iteratively visiting the nearest unvisited nodes, providing a baseline solution that can be refined further with other heuristics. This heuristic exploits the average distance metric, which is moderate, indicating that this approach can efficiently explore the solution space in the early stages.

---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state of the solution shows that only one vehicle has a partial route, and the rest have not yet been utilized. The Nearest Neighbor heuristic has successfully initiated route construction with a reasonable cost. Given the moderate average distance and unvisited nodes, continuing with the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for another 10 steps will help further develop initial routes efficiently.

---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic has demonstrated effective progress in incrementally constructing initial routes, as evidenced by the increase in the number of visited nodes and the fulfillment of demands with a reasonable cost. Given the current state, where there are still a significant number of unvisited nodes and available vehicle capacity, continuing with the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for another 10 steps is strategic. This choice leverages its strength in expanding routes efficiently under moderate average distance conditions, further developing the current solution while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.

Delta of Current Cost: 124.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 122
---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The nearest neighbor heuristic has demonstrated effectiveness in the current scenario by consistently increasing the number of visited nodes and fulfilling demands. Given the remaining unvisited nodes and available vehicle capacity, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps will likely lead to further progress in constructing a feasible solution. The moderate average distance suggests that this heuristic can still efficiently explore the solution space.

Delta of Current Cost: 48.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 151
---Round 4---
Heuristic: saving_algorithm_710e

Running Steps: 10
Explain: The saving algorithm can help optimize the current solution by exploring potential savings in combining routes, addressing vehicle load balancing, and utilizing vehicle capacity more efficiently. Given the current state of the solution with a high number of unvisited nodes and available capacity, this approach aims to refine the routes and improve the overall solution quality.

---Round 6---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: min_cost_insertion_7bfa. How does min_cost_insertion_7bfa perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Based on the provided global and state data, as well as the summary of the previous rounds, here's an analysis and recommendation for the next steps:

The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic has been effective in strategically inserting unvisited nodes with minimal additional cost, which aligns well with the current need to reduce the number of unvisited nodes and fulfill remaining demands. Given the current state where 41 nodes remain unvisited and the vehicle capacity utilization is high, continuing with Min-Cost Insertion seems appropriate.

**Recommendation**:

1. **Selected Heuristic**: Min-Cost Insertion
2. **Running Steps**: 5
3. **Explanation**: Continuing with Min-Cost Insertion for 5 steps is strategic because it has previously shown effectiveness in reducing unvisited nodes while maintaining reasonable cost increases. This approach will further optimize the current solution by strategically placing unvisited nodes where they incur the least additional cost, leveraging the high vehicle capacity utilization.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa
running steps: 5
explanation: Continuing with Min-Cost Insertion for 5 steps is strategic because it has previously shown effectiveness in reducing unvisited nodes while maintaining reasonable cost increases.
