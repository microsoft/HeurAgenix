The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance.

This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions.

Here\u2019s an analysis of when each heuristic might be most suitable:\n\n1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful when the problem involves a sparse network or when it's crucial to address the outliers (farther nodes) early in the process to ensure they are efficiently integrated into the routes.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: The spatial distribution of nodes, particularly where some nodes are significantly farther from the depot or other nodes.\n\n2. **Greedy Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for problems where computational speed is a priority and an initial solution is needed quickly, potentially as a starting point for further refinement.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: The density and proximity of nodes, as the algorithm focuses on short-term gains by choosing the nearest unvisited node.\n\n3. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where minimizing the incremental cost of adding nodes to routes is critical, often providing a good balance between solution quality and computational effort.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Cost-effectiveness of route expansions and the ability to accommodate additional nodes without significant cost increases.\n\n4. **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Effective in dense networks where nearest connections are likely to be part of the optimal route. It's a straightforward approach that\u2019s easy to implement and understand.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Node density and average distance between nodes, emphasizing short connections.\n\n5. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Useful for scenarios requiring load balancing across vehicles or when initial routes can be improved by relocating nodes.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Imbalance in route loads or potential benefits from shifting nodes between routes.\n\n6. **Petal Algorithm**: \n   - **Scenario**: Applicable in cases where routes naturally form loops around a central depot. It\u2019s advantageous when routes can be easily visualized as petals around a central point.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Centralized node distribution with radial route patterns.\n\n7. **Random Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Best used in exploratory phases or when generating diverse initial solutions for metaheuristics like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Situations requiring randomness to escape local optima or to serve as a baseline comparison.\n\n8. **Saving Algorithm**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when there are significant potential savings in merging routes. It\u2019s often used when vehicle capacity constraints are not the primary limiting factor.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Potential distance or cost savings from merging routes, assessed through savings calculations.\n\n9. **Three-Opt Heuristic**: \n   - **Scenario**: Appropriate for refining solutions where multiple route segments can be improved simultaneously, especially in dense networks.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Potential for significant route improvements through more complex segment swaps.\n\n10. **Two-Opt Heuristic**: \n    - **Scenario**: Suitable for local optimization, where small improvements in route efficiency are possible by swapping two edges.\n    - **Best Quantified By**: Solutions close to optimal where small perturbations can yield improvements.\n\n11. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**: \n    - **Scenario**: Best used when solutions are stuck in local optima, as VNS systematically explores different neighborhoods to find better solutions.\n    - **Best Quantified By**: The diversity of neighborhood structures and the problem\u2019s susceptibility to different local search strategies.\n\nThese heuristics are applicable based on the specific problem characteristics, computational resources, and the desired balance between solution quality and processing time."

It will quickly construct initial routes by iteratively visiting the nearest unvisited nodes, providing a baseline solution that can be refined further with other heuristics. This heuristic exploits the average distance metric, which is moderate, indicating that this approach can efficiently explore the solution space in the early stages.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 43.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 160\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state of the solution shows that only one vehicle has a partial route, and the rest have not yet been utilized. The Nearest Neighbor heuristic has successfully initiated route construction with a reasonable cost. Given the moderate average distance and unvisited nodes, continuing with the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for another 10 steps will help further develop initial routes efficiently. This will enhance the baseline solution by utilizing more vehicles and addressing the unvisited nodes while respecting capacity constraints.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 54.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 161\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic has demonstrated effective progress in incrementally constructing initial routes, as evidenced by the increase in the number of visited nodes and the fulfillment of demands with a reasonable cost.
