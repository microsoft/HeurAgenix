I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP). It involves finding the most efficient way to route vehicles to meet constraints such as vehicle capacities and minimizing the total distance or cost. Heuristics are a well-established approach for solving COPs like CVRP, especially given their NP-hard nature. Your framework for solutions, operators, and standardized heuristic function signatures aligns well with the structure of a COP and is appropriate for heuristic-based methods.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To analyze the applicability of each heuristic algorithm, we must consider the characteristics of the problem instance, such as problem size, demand distribution, depot and customer location, and vehicle constraints. Hereâs the analysis for each heuristic and the scenarios in which they are best applicable:

---

### **1. Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Sparse and widely distributed nodes**: This heuristic is effective when nodes are far apart because it considers farthest nodes for insertion, ensuring that distant locations are connected efficiently.
- **High vehicle utilization desired**: The scoring mechanism that incorporates capacity utilization can improve solutions where high vehicle utilization is critical.
- **Moderate number of nodes and vehicles**: Works well when there is sufficient computation time to calculate improved routes iteratively.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Node distribution**: Works best when the average inter-node distance is high (e.g., mean inter-node distance > 10% of the maximum distance in the distance matrix).
- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized problems (e.g., 50â150 nodes).

---

### **2. Optimized Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Dense and clustered nodes**: This heuristic excels when nodes are closer together, as it minimizes insertion costs for compact routes.
- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Faster than more complex heuristics, making it ideal for problems with fewer nodes or when a quick solution is required.
- **Uniform demand distribution**: Works best when demands are evenly distributed among nodes.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Node clustering**: Effective when the standard deviation of inter-node distances is low (e.g., < 20% of the mean distance).
- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 20â100 nodes).

---

### **3. Enhanced Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Simple initial solution**: This heuristic is often used to create a quick, feasible initial solution that can be improved with other methods (e.g., 2-opt or 3-opt).
- **Low computational budget**: Fast and computationally efficient, making it ideal for solving large problems quickly.
- **High demand variability**: Prioritizing high-demand nodes ensures that vehicles are effectively utilized.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Problem size**: Suitable for large problems (e.g., 100â500 nodes) where speed is prioritized over solution quality.
- **Demand variability**: Works well when the coefficient of variation (CV) of node demands is high (e.g., CV > 0.3).

---

### **4. Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **High merge opportunities**: Effective when there are many opportunities to merge routes, such as when nodes are clustered around the depot or along shared paths.
- **Merge threshold tuning**: The `merge_threshold` parameter can be adjusted to control the trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.
- **Moderate to large problems**: Scales well with an increase in the number of nodes.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Node clustering relative to depot**: Best when a significant proportion of nodes (e.g., > 50%) are within a certain distance from the depot (e.g., 20% of the maximum distance).
- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium to large problems (e.g., 50â300 nodes).
- **Merge threshold**: Lower thresholds (e.g., 0â0.2) are better for tighter capacity constraints.

---

### **5. 3-opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **High-quality solution refinement**: 3-opt is a local search heuristic that is computationally intensive but produces high-quality solutions by exploring multiple route rearrangements.
- **Final solution improvement**: Best applied after an initial solution has been generated by a simpler heuristic (e.g., nearest neighbor or saving algorithm).
- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Due to its computational complexity, it is better suited for smaller problem sizes.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium problems (e.g., 20â150 nodes).
- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 20â30% of the estimated optimal solution.

---

### **6. 2-opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Route compactness improvement**: 2-opt works well for improving route compactness by eliminating unnecessary route crossings.
- **Medium computational budget**: Faster than 3-opt, making it suitable for larger problems or when computational time is limited.
- **Initial solution improvement**: Like 3-opt, it is often applied after generating an initial solution.
#### **Quantification:**
- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized to large problems (e.g., 50â300 nodes).
- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 30â40% of the estimated optimal solution.

---

### **Summary of Applicability**
| **Heuristic**           | **Best for Problem Size** | **Node Distribution**             | **Demand Variability** | **Purpose**                     |

| saving_algorithm_710e    | Medium to large          | Clustered around depot            | Any                    | Merge routes efficiently         |
| three_opt_e8d7           | Small to medium          | Any                                | Any                    | High-quality solution refinement|
| two_opt_0554             | Medium to large          | Any                                | Any                    | Route compactness improvement   |

### **Key Insights**
1. **Initial Solution Heuristics**: Nearest Neighbor and Min-Cost Insertion are excellent for generating initial solutions quickly.
2. **Refinement Heuristics**: 2-opt and 3-opt are ideal for improving initial solutions, with 2-opt being faster and 3-opt providing higher quality.
3. **Specialized Heuristics**: Farthest Insertion and Saving Algorithm are more scenario-specific, excelling in cases where node distribution or merging opportunities are unique.

By understanding the problem characteristics, you can strategically combine these heuristics to achieve high-quality solutions while balancing computational efficiency.

Explain: The current state indicates that no nodes have been visited (except the depot), and the solution is at its initial stage. Nearest Neighbor is computationally efficient and well-suited for generating an initial feasible solution by quickly assigning nodes to routes. Given the high number of unvisited nodes (199), this heuristic will help construct a basic solution. The 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding to continue or switch to another heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 47.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 198
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state still has a high number of unvisited nodes (189), and the initial application of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` performed well by visiting 10 nodes with a reasonable cost increase of 47.0 while serving 198 demands. This heuristic remains efficient at this stage for further constructing the solution, given its ability to quickly assign unvisited nodes to routes. Running another 10 steps will help expand the solution and allow us to better evaluate the overall progress before considering switching to refinement-focused heuristics.

---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state still indicates a high number of unvisited nodes (179), and `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has demonstrated good performance in the previous two rounds, visiting 10 nodes at a reasonable cost increment while fulfilling significant demand. Given the computational efficiency of this heuristic and its ability to construct the solution further, running another 10 steps is appropriate to continue building the solution. This will provide more progress before assessing whether a switch to refinement heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, is necessary.

---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state still indicates a high number of unvisited nodes (169), and `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has performed well in the previous rounds, consistently visiting nodes with reasonable cost increments while fulfilling significant demand. Given its computational efficiency and ability to further construct the solution, running another 10 steps is appropriate to continue building the solution. This will help reduce the number of unvisited nodes and provide more progress before considering refinement-focused heuristics like 2-opt or 3-opt.

---Round 4---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has made significant progress in constructing routes, with 41 nodes visited and 159 still unvisited. The cost increment from the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been reasonable, but the average route length (2.35) and total cost (198.0) suggest room for improvement in route compactness and efficiency. Applying `two_opt_0554` for 10 steps will help refine the existing routes by eliminating unnecessary crossings and improving route compactness, which is essential before further constructing the solution with another heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -2.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The application of `two_opt_0554` in the last round yielded a slight improvement by reducing the total cost by 2.0 without changing the number of visited nodes. This indicates that the heuristic is effectively improving route compactness. Given the current state of the solution, with an average route length of 2.35 and some routes having significant room for compactness improvement, running another 10 steps of `two_opt_0554` is a logical choice to further refine the solution. This will help achieve better efficiency before considering a switch to `three_opt_e8d7` for deeper refinement or returning to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 6---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows that `two_opt_0554` has reached diminishing returns in terms of improvement, as the last two rounds yielded minimal to no changes in total cost or solution quality. Given the current solution's progress and the need for deeper refinement, applying `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical next step. This heuristic will allow for more complex route rearrangements and further improve route compactness and efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will help evaluate its effectiveness before deciding whether to continue or switch back to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.

Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: 4.47), running another 10 steps of `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical choice. This will allow the heuristic to explore more complex route rearrangements and potentially uncover better solutions.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
running steps: 10
explanation: The previous two rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have not yet yielded measurable improvements, but this heuristic typically requires more steps to explore complex route rearrangements effectively. Given the high standard deviation of route lengths (4.47) and the presence of long routes, continuing with another 10 steps of `three_opt_e8d7` is logical to allow it to uncover better solutions. If no significant improvements occur in this round, we can consider returning to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.
