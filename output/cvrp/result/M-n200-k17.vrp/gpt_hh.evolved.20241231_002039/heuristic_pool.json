                "text": "To analyze the applicability of each heuristic algorithm, we must consider the characteristics of the problem instance, such as problem size, demand distribution, depot and customer location, and vehicle constraints. Here\u2019s the analysis for each heuristic and the scenarios in which they are best applicable:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Sparse and widely distributed nodes**: This heuristic is effective when nodes are far apart because it considers farthest nodes for insertion, ensuring that distant locations are connected efficiently.\n- **High vehicle utilization desired**: The scoring mechanism that incorporates capacity utilization can improve solutions where high vehicle utilization is critical.\n- **Moderate number of nodes and vehicles**: Works well when there is sufficient computation time to calculate improved routes iteratively.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node distribution**: Works best when the average inter-node distance is high (e.g., mean inter-node distance > 10% of the maximum distance in the distance matrix).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized problems (e.g., 50\u2013150 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Optimized Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Dense and clustered nodes**: This heuristic excels when nodes are closer together, as it minimizes insertion costs for compact routes.\n- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Faster than more complex heuristics, making it ideal for problems with fewer nodes or when a quick solution is required.\n- **Uniform demand distribution**: Works best when demands are evenly distributed among nodes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node clustering**: Effective when the standard deviation of inter-node distances is low (e.g., < 20% of the mean distance).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 20\u2013100 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Enhanced Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Simple initial solution**: This heuristic is often used to create a quick, feasible initial solution that can be improved with other methods (e.g., 2-opt or 3-opt).\n- **Low computational budget**: Fast and computationally efficient, making it ideal for solving large problems quickly.\n- **High demand variability**: Prioritizing high-demand nodes ensures that vehicles are effectively utilized.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for large problems (e.g., 100\u2013500 nodes) where speed is prioritized over solution quality.\n- **Demand variability**: Works well when the coefficient of variation (CV) of node demands is high (e.g., CV > 0.3).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **High merge opportunities**: Effective when there are many opportunities to merge routes, such as when nodes are clustered around the depot or along shared paths.\n- **Merge threshold tuning**: The `merge_threshold` parameter can be adjusted to control the trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.\n- **Moderate to large problems**: Scales well with an increase in the number of nodes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node clustering relative to depot**: Best when a significant proportion of nodes (e.g., > 50%) are within a certain distance from the depot (e.g., 20% of the maximum distance).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium to large problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).\n- **Merge threshold**: Lower thresholds (e.g., 0\u20130.2) are better for tighter capacity constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **5. 3-opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **High-quality solution refinement**: 3-opt is a local search heuristic that is computationally intensive but produces high-quality solutions by exploring multiple route rearrangements.\n- **Final solution improvement**: Best applied after an initial solution has been generated by a simpler heuristic (e.g., nearest neighbor or saving algorithm).\n- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Due to its computational complexity, it is better suited for smaller problem sizes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium problems (e.g., 20\u2013150 nodes).\n- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 20\u201330% of the estimated optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **6. 2-opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Route compactness improvement**: 2-opt works well for improving route compactness by eliminating unnecessary route crossings.\n- **Medium computational budget**: Faster than 3-opt, making it suitable for larger problems or when computational time is limited.\n- **Initial solution improvement**: Like 3-opt, it is often applied after generating an initial solution.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized to large problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).\n- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 30\u201340% of the estimated optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Applicability**\n| **Heuristic**           | **Best for Problem Size** | **Node Distribution**             | **Demand Variability** | **Purpose**                     |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| farthest_insertion_6308  | Medium                   | Sparse and widely distributed      | Moderate               | High vehicle utilization        |\n| min_cost_insertion_3b2b  | Small to medium          | Dense and clustered               | Uniform                | Efficient initial solution      |\n| nearest_neighbor_54a9    | Large                    | Any                                | High                   | Quick initial solution          |\n| saving_algorithm_710e    | Medium to large          | Clustered around depot            | Any                    | Merge routes efficiently         |\n| three_opt_e8d7           | Small to medium          | Any                                | Any                    | High-quality solution refinement|\n| two_opt_0554             | Medium to large          | Any                                | Any                    | Route compactness improvement   |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights**\n1. **Initial Solution Heuristics**: Nearest Neighbor and Min-Cost Insertion are excellent for generating initial solutions quickly.\n2. **Refinement Heuristics**: 2-opt and 3-opt are ideal for improving initial solutions, with 2-opt being faster and 3-opt providing higher quality.\n3. **Specialized Heuristics**: Farthest Insertion and Saving Algorithm are more scenario-specific, excelling in cases where node distribution or merging opportunities are unique.\n\nBy understanding the problem characteristics, you can strategically combine these heuristics to achieve high-quality solutions while balancing computational efficiency."
