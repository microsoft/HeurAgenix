                "text": "To analyze the applicability of each heuristic algorithm, we must consider the characteristics of the problem instance, such as problem size, demand distribution, depot and customer location, and vehicle constraints. Here\u2019s the analysis for each heuristic and the scenarios in which they are best applicable:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Sparse and widely distributed nodes**: This heuristic is effective when nodes are far apart because it considers farthest nodes for insertion, ensuring that distant locations are connected efficiently.\n- **High vehicle utilization desired**: The scoring mechanism that incorporates capacity utilization can improve solutions where high vehicle utilization is critical.\n- **Moderate number of nodes and vehicles**: Works well when there is sufficient computation time to calculate improved routes iteratively.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node distribution**: Works best when the average inter-node distance is high (e.g., mean inter-node distance > 10% of the maximum distance in the distance matrix).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized problems (e.g., 50\u2013150 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Optimized Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Dense and clustered nodes**: This heuristic excels when nodes are closer together, as it minimizes insertion costs for compact routes.\n- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Faster than more complex heuristics, making it ideal for problems with fewer nodes or when a quick solution is required.\n- **Uniform demand distribution**: Works best when demands are evenly distributed among nodes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node clustering**: Effective when the standard deviation of inter-node distances is low (e.g., < 20% of the mean distance).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 20\u2013100 nodes).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Enhanced Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Simple initial solution**: This heuristic is often used to create a quick, feasible initial solution that can be improved with other methods (e.g., 2-opt or 3-opt).\n- **Low computational budget**: Fast and computationally efficient, making it ideal for solving large problems quickly.\n- **High demand variability**: Prioritizing high-demand nodes ensures that vehicles are effectively utilized.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for large problems (e.g., 100\u2013500 nodes) where speed is prioritized over solution quality.\n- **Demand variability**: Works well when the coefficient of variation (CV) of node demands is high (e.g., CV > 0.3).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **High merge opportunities**: Effective when there are many opportunities to merge routes, such as when nodes are clustered around the depot or along shared paths.\n- **Merge threshold tuning**: The `merge_threshold` parameter can be adjusted to control the trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.\n- **Moderate to large problems**: Scales well with an increase in the number of nodes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Node clustering relative to depot**: Best when a significant proportion of nodes (e.g., > 50%) are within a certain distance from the depot (e.g., 20% of the maximum distance).\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium to large problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).\n- **Merge threshold**: Lower thresholds (e.g., 0\u20130.2) are better for tighter capacity constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **5. 3-opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **High-quality solution refinement**: 3-opt is a local search heuristic that is computationally intensive but produces high-quality solutions by exploring multiple route rearrangements.\n- **Final solution improvement**: Best applied after an initial solution has been generated by a simpler heuristic (e.g., nearest neighbor or saving algorithm).\n- **Small to medium-sized problems**: Due to its computational complexity, it is better suited for smaller problem sizes.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for small to medium problems (e.g., 20\u2013150 nodes).\n- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 20\u201330% of the estimated optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **6. 2-opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- **Route compactness improvement**: 2-opt works well for improving route compactness by eliminating unnecessary route crossings.\n- **Medium computational budget**: Faster than 3-opt, making it suitable for larger problems or when computational time is limited.\n- **Initial solution improvement**: Like 3-opt, it is often applied after generating an initial solution.\n#### **Quantification:**\n- **Problem size**: Suitable for medium-sized to large problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).\n- **Solution refinement**: Best when the initial solution has a total cost within 30\u201340% of the estimated optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Applicability**\n| **Heuristic**           | **Best for Problem Size** | **Node Distribution**             | **Demand Variability** | **Purpose**                     |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| farthest_insertion_6308  | Medium                   | Sparse and widely distributed      | Moderate               | High vehicle utilization        |\n| min_cost_insertion_3b2b  | Small to medium          | Dense and clustered               | Uniform                | Efficient initial solution      |\n| nearest_neighbor_54a9    | Large                    | Any                                | High                   | Quick initial solution          |\n| saving_algorithm_710e    | Medium to large          | Clustered around depot            | Any                    | Merge routes efficiently         |\n| three_opt_e8d7           | Small to medium          | Any                                | Any                    | High-quality solution refinement|\n| two_opt_0554             | Medium to large          | Any                                | Any                    | Route compactness improvement   |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights**\n1. **Initial Solution Heuristics**: Nearest Neighbor and Min-Cost Insertion are excellent for generating initial solutions quickly.\n2. **Refinement Heuristics**: 2-opt and 3-opt are ideal for improving initial solutions, with 2-opt being faster and 3-opt providing higher quality.\n3. **Specialized Heuristics**: Farthest Insertion and Saving Algorithm are more scenario-specific, excelling in cases where node distribution or merging opportunities are unique.\n\nBy understanding the problem characteristics, you can strategically combine these heuristics to achieve high-quality solutions while balancing computational efficiency."

Nearest Neighbor is computationally efficient and well-suited for generating an initial feasible solution by quickly assigning nodes to routes. Given the high number of unvisited nodes (199), this heuristic will help construct a basic solution. The 10 steps will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness before deciding to continue or switch to another heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 47.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 198\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state still has a high number of unvisited nodes (189), and the initial application of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` performed well by visiting 10 nodes with a reasonable cost increase of 47.0 while serving 198 demands. This heuristic remains efficient at this stage for further constructing the solution, given its ability to quickly assign unvisited nodes to routes. Running another 10 steps will help expand the solution and allow us to better evaluate the overall progress before considering switching to refinement-focused heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 42.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 164\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state still indicates a high number of unvisited nodes (179), and `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has demonstrated good performance in the previous two rounds, visiting 10 nodes at a reasonable cost increment while fulfilling significant demand. Given the computational efficiency of this heuristic and its ability to construct the solution further, running another 10 steps is appropriate to continue building the solution. This will provide more progress before assessing whether a switch to refinement heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, is necessary.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 50.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 148\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state still indicates a high number of unvisited nodes (169), and `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has performed well in the previous rounds, consistently visiting nodes with reasonable cost increments while fulfilling significant demand. Given its computational efficiency and ability to further construct the solution, running another 10 steps is appropriate to continue building the solution. This will help reduce the number of unvisited nodes and provide more progress before considering refinement-focused heuristics like 2-opt or 3-opt.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 59.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 199\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has made significant progress in constructing routes, with 41 nodes visited and 159 still unvisited. The cost increment from the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been reasonable, but the average route length (2.35) and total cost (198.0) suggest room for improvement in route compactness and efficiency. Applying `two_opt_0554` for 10 steps will help refine the existing routes by eliminating unnecessary crossings and improving route compactness, which is essential before further constructing the solution with another heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -2.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The application of `two_opt_0554` in the last round yielded a slight improvement by reducing the total cost by 2.0 without changing the number of visited nodes. This indicates that the heuristic is effectively improving route compactness. Given the current state of the solution, with an average route length of 2.35 and some routes having significant room for compactness improvement, running another 10 steps of `two_opt_0554` is a logical choice to further refine the solution. This will help achieve better efficiency before considering a switch to `three_opt_e8d7` for deeper refinement or returning to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that `two_opt_0554` has reached diminishing returns in terms of improvement, as the last two rounds yielded minimal to no changes in total cost or solution quality. Given the current solution's progress and the need for deeper refinement, applying `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical next step. This heuristic will allow for more complex route rearrangements and further improve route compactness and efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will help evaluate its effectiveness before deciding whether to continue or switch back to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: 4.47), running another 10 steps of `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical choice. This will allow the heuristic to explore more complex route rearrangements and potentially uncover better solutions.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous two rounds of `three_opt_e8d7` have not yet yielded measurable improvements, but this heuristic typically requires more steps to explore complex route rearrangements effectively. Given the high standard deviation of route lengths (4.47) and the presence of long routes, continuing with another 10 steps of `three_opt_e8d7` is logical to allow it to uncover better solutions. If no significant improvements occur in this round, we can consider returning to a construction heuristic for unvisited nodes.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that no significant improvement has been achieved in the last three rounds of applying `three_opt_e8d7`, suggesting diminishing returns from refinement-focused heuristics. Given that 159 nodes remain unvisited and the total remaining demand is 2477, the focus should shift back to constructing the solution further. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is computationally efficient and effective at quickly assigning unvisited nodes to routes, making it the most appropriate choice for this stage. Running it for 10 steps will help reduce the number of unvisited nodes and make progress towards a more complete solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 61.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 99\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that 149 nodes remain unvisited, and the total remaining demand is still significant at 2378. Given the effectiveness of `nearest_neighbor_54a9` in quickly assigning unvisited nodes to routes, it is appropriate to continue building the solution with this heuristic. Previous rounds have demonstrated its ability to visit 10 nodes per iteration while maintaining reasonable cost increments and fulfilling substantial demands. Running another 10 steps will allow further progress towards reducing the number of unvisited nodes before considering a refinement heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 44.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 166\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that 139 nodes remain unvisited, and the total remaining demand is still significant at 2212. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has demonstrated consistent performance in previous rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes while maintaining reasonable cost increments. Given the high number of unvisited nodes and the heuristic's computational efficiency, it is appropriate to continue constructing the solution with this heuristic. Running another 10 steps will allow further progress towards reducing the number of unvisited nodes before considering refinement heuristics like 2-opt or 3-opt.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 82.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 131\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state shows that there are still 129 unvisited nodes with a total remaining demand of 2081. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated good performance in previous rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes and fulfilling a significant portion of the demand while maintaining reasonable cost increments. Given the high number of unvisited nodes and the heuristic's computational efficiency, it is appropriate to continue constructing the solution with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` for another 10 steps. This will allow us to make further progress towards reducing the number of unvisited nodes before reassessing whether refinement heuristics like `2-opt` or `3-opt` should be applied.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 77.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 124\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current state still has 119 unvisited nodes, with a total remaining demand of 1957. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in previous rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes while maintaining reasonable cost increments and fulfilling significant demand. Given the high number of unvisited nodes and the heuristic's computational efficiency, it is logical to continue building the solution with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` for another 10 steps. This will make further progress towards reducing the number of unvisited nodes before considering refinement heuristics like `2-opt` or `3-opt`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 50.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 167\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
