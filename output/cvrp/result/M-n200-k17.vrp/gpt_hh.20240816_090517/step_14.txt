I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Sure, I can help analyze the scenarios where each algorithm might be most applicable and how these scenarios can be best quantified. Here's an overview:

### 1. **Two-Opt Algorithm**
- **Scenario:** 
  - Best for improving existing solutions by locally optimizing the route.
  - Effective when routes are nearly optimal and only require minor adjustments.
- **Quantification:**
  - Lower local search space.
  - High initial route quality (e.g., obtained from another heuristic).
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems with moderate node density.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for escaping local optima by exploring different neighborhood structures.
  - Suitable for problems where a diverse set of operators might be necessary.
- **Quantification:**
  - Larger search space with potential for multiple local optima.
  - High variability in node distribution and demand.
  - Suitable for medium to large-sized problems.

### 3. **Three-Opt Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Similar to Two-Opt but allows for more complex rearrangements.
  - Suitable for more intricate route optimization needs.
- **Quantification:**
  - Higher initial route quality.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems with dense node clusters.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Good for initial route construction.
  - Effective for problems where a quick, feasible solution is needed.
- **Quantification:**
  - High node density and uniform distribution.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems with low variance in demand.

### 5. **Greedy Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Similar to Nearest Neighbor but focuses on the closest unvisited node.
  - Suitable for quick, feasible solutions.
- **Quantification:**
  - High node density and uniform distribution.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for merging routes to save on total distance.
  - Suitable for problems where route consolidation can yield significant savings.
- **Quantification:**
  - High initial number of routes.
  - Suitable for medium to large-sized problems with high variability in node distances.

### 7. **Random Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Useful for generating diverse initial solutions.
  - Suitable for problems where exploration of a wide range of solutions is beneficial.
- **Quantification:**
  - High node density with uniform distribution.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for constructing routes around a central depot.
  - Suitable for problems with a centralized depot and radial distribution of nodes.
- **Quantification:**
  - High centralization of nodes around the depot.
  - Suitable for medium to large-sized problems.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for ensuring coverage of farthest nodes early in the route construction.
  - Suitable for problems where outliers need to be managed effectively.
- **Quantification:**
  - High variance in node distances.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems with significant outliers.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for balancing load between different routes.
  - Suitable for problems where load balancing is critical.
- **Quantification:**
  - High initial route imbalance.
  - Suitable for medium to large-sized problems.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion Algorithm**
- **Scenario:**
  - Effective for inserting nodes in a cost-effective manner.
  - Suitable for problems where cost minimization is critical.
- **Quantification:**
  - High cost sensitivity.
  - Suitable for small to medium-sized problems.

In summary, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, including node density, distribution, demand variability, and the need for initial solution quality versus local optimization. Each algorithm has its strengths and is best suited for different types of CVRP scenarios.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state and the historical application of heuristics, let's analyze the situation and determine the best next steps:

### Current State Analysis
- **Visited Nodes:** 200 (all nodes are visited)
- **Unvisited Nodes:** 0
- **Fulfilled Demands:** 3186
- **Remaining Demands:** 0
- **Total Current Cost:** 1789.0
- **Vehicle Information:** Some vehicles have a high load, while others are significantly underutilized (e.g., vehicle 16).
- **Last Heuristic Used:** Three-Opt

### Decision Considerations
1. **Three-Opt Performance:** The last heuristic used was Three-Opt, which made only a minor improvement in cost (-4.0).
2. **Load Balancing:** There is an imbalance in vehicle utilization, with some vehicles at full capacity and others underutilized.
3. **Cost Reduction:** The focus should be on further reducing the total cost and balancing the load among vehicles.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS):** Previously used effectively to escape local optima and optimize routes. Might be beneficial to revisit this for further optimization.
- **Node Shift Between Routes:** Used previously for balancing load but with mixed success.
- **Min-Cost Insertion:** Recently used to incorporate remaining unvisited nodes. Now all nodes are visited, so it's less relevant.
- **Three-Opt:** Minor improvement in the last round.
- **Other Heuristics:** Random, Greedy, Nearest Neighbor, and others are more suited for initial solution construction rather than fine-tuning.

### Recommendation
Given the goal of further reducing the total cost and balancing the load among vehicles, I recommend revisiting the **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)** heuristic. This heuristic has shown effectiveness in previous rounds and can explore different neighborhood structures to find better solutions.

### Action Plan
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
running steps: 30
explanation: We will use the Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic to further optimize the current routes, aiming to reduce the total cost and balance the load among vehicles. This heuristic can explore different neighborhood structures to find better solutions.
