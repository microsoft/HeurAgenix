I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

***is_cop:yes***  

Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves searching through a discrete solution space (possible routes for vehicles) to find an optimal solution that minimizes a cost function (e.g., total distance or cost) while satisfying constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity, visiting all customers, and returning to the depot).  

The solution framework, operator definitions, and heuristic function signature you provided are well-aligned with addressing such problems using heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches. CVRP is a classic example where heuristics like those facilitated by your operators (e.g., Append, Insert, Swap, etc.) are frequently used to iteratively improve solutions.  

Analysis outside ***: None of the provided elements (Solution, Operators, Data structures) seem incorrect or out of place for this context.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To determine the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable, we need to consider the characteristics of the problem instance, such as the number of nodes, vehicle capacity, demand distribution, and geographic distribution of the nodes. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic may perform best, along with quantifiable metrics that can guide their applicability:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances with a high number of nodes and when the goal is to create compact routes with a balance between cost and capacity utilization.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for moderate to large-scale instances (e.g., >50 nodes).
     - **Demand Variability**: Performs better when demands are moderately dispersed.
     - **Geographic Spread**: Effective when nodes are unevenly distributed in space (e.g., clusters of nodes with sparse regions in between).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces relatively compact routes.
     - Periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps enhance solution quality.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computational cost increases with the number of nodes due to scoring mechanism and periodic improvements.

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where computational efficiency is critical, such as large-scale problems or real-time decision-making.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs efficiently on large-scale instances (e.g., >100 nodes).
     - **Time Constraint**: Suitable when solution time is a key constraint (e.g., must generate a solution within seconds or minutes).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Optimized for speed and simplicity while maintaining solution quality.
     - Handles capacity constraints effectively.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May not produce the most compact routes compared to other heuristics.

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**
   - **Scenario**: Works best for small to medium-sized instances where the primary goal is to build routes quickly, such as in routing problems with a lower number of nodes.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs well on small-to-medium problems (e.g., <50 nodes).
     - **Demand Density**: Effective when demands are uniform or when higher-demand nodes are critical to prioritize.
     - **Geographic Spread**: Performs well when nodes are evenly distributed in space.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Quick to compute and simple to implement.
     - Incorporates 2-opt to improve route compactness.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Can lead to suboptimal solutions for larger or more complex instances.
     - May generate longer routes due to its greedy nature.

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for problems with a small-to-moderate number of vehicles and when there is significant potential for route merging to reduce costs.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs well on medium-scale problems (e.g., 30â100 nodes).
     - **Vehicle Count**: Effective when the number of vehicles is small-to-moderate (e.g., <10 vehicles).
     - **Merge Threshold**: Higher merge thresholds are better when merging routes is more cost-effective (e.g., when nodes are geographically dispersed).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces cost-efficient routes by merging routes with the highest savings.
     - Accounts for vehicle capacity constraints during merging.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May struggle with very large instances or instances with highly constrained capacities.

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for refining solutions to achieve high-quality routes, especially when the initial solution is already near optimal. Best used as a post-processing step.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-medium-sized instances (e.g., <100 nodes), but computational cost increases significantly with node count.
     - **Initial Solution Quality**: More effective when the initial solution is of moderate quality (e.g., routes are not highly fragmented).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces highly optimized routes by considering multiple segment reversals.
     - Can significantly reduce route costs in some cases.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computationally expensive, especially for larger problems.
     - Requires a good initial solution to be effective.

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**
   - **Scenario**: Similar to `three_opt_e8d7`, this heuristic is best used for refining solutions, but it is computationally less intensive and can be applied to larger instances.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-large instances (e.g., 30â500 nodes).
     - **Initial Solution Quality**: Effective when the initial solution is suboptimal (e.g., routes are long and overlapping).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple and computationally efficient compared to 3-opt.
     - Can be applied iteratively to improve solution quality.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May not achieve the same level of optimization as 3-opt for small problems.

---

### Recommendations:
- Use **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`** or **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`** for quickly generating initial solutions.
- Apply **`two_opt_0554`** or **`three_opt_e8d7`** for refining solutions to reduce costs further.
- Use **`farthest_insertion_6308`** or **`saving_algorithm_710e`** when compact routes or cost-efficient merging is critical.

Before this discuss, we have already 15 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows that all vehicles are uninitialized with no nodes visited, and the unvisited node count is high (199). The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for initializing solutions quickly, especially in small steps. Since the demands and distances are moderate, this heuristic can provide a quick starting point by prioritizing nodes that fit vehicle capacities while minimizing initial route costs. After 10 steps, we can assess the quality of the initial solution and decide whether to continue or switch heuristics.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 47.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 198
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution shows that only one vehicle is partially utilized, with a significant number of unvisited nodes (189) and a large remaining total demand (2988). Since the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic performed reasonably well in the first round (adding 10 nodes and fulfilling 198 demands), it remains a good choice for further initialization of the solution. The heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on demand and proximity can continue to quickly construct routes while respecting vehicle capacities. Running for another 10 steps allows us to continue building the solution incrementally while monitoring progress.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 42.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 164
---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution shows that progress is being made, with 21 nodes visited and a significant number of unvisited nodes (179) still remaining. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the previous two rounds, adding 10 nodes per round and fulfilling substantial demands (198 and 164, respectively). While the average remaining vehicle capacity is high (178.7), indicating that vehicles are underutilized, the heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on proximity and demand continues to be effective for incrementally building the solution. Running for another 10 steps allows further progress while maintaining a methodical approach to constructing the solution.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 50.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 148
---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in the past three rounds, demonstrating the ability to incrementally construct the solution by adding 10 nodes per round while fulfilling substantial demands. Currently, there are still 169 unvisited nodes, and the vehicles have significant remaining capacities. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is effective for further initialization of the solution by prioritizing nodes with higher demands and proximity. Running it for another 10 steps will allow us to continue building the solution methodically while monitoring progress.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 59.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 199
---Round 4---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in the previous rounds, incrementally constructing the solution by adding 10 nodes per round and fulfilling substantial demands. Currently, there are still 159 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (2477). The heuristic's prioritization of nodes with higher demands and proximity remains effective for further initialization of the solution. Running for another 10 steps allows us to continue building the solution while monitoring progress and assessing the diminishing returns of this heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 61.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 99
---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in initializing the solution by prioritizing nodes based on proximity and demand. While diminishing returns are evident (with fewer nodes added and lower demand fulfilled in recent rounds), it is still effective for constructing the solution incrementally. The current state shows 149 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (2378). Running the heuristic for another 10 steps will allow us to continue building the solution while monitoring its diminishing effectiveness.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 44.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 166
---Round 6---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been consistently effective in incrementally constructing the solution. While diminishing returns are becoming apparent, there are still 139 unvisited nodes and a significant remaining demand of 2212. This heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on proximity and demand makes it suitable for continuing the initialization process. Running for another 10 steps will allow us to assess its effectiveness further and decide whether to transition to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` afterward.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 82.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 131
---Round 7---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in constructing the initial solution over multiple rounds, but diminishing returns are evident. The current solution's average route cost and total cost indicate room for improvement in route compactness. The `two_opt_0554` heuristic is well-suited for refining the solution by reducing route overlap and improving route efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to test its effectiveness in reducing the total cost while preserving the solution's validity. If successful, further refinement or transition to `three_opt_e8d7` can be considered.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -3.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 8---
Heuristic: two_opt_0554
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic demonstrated a slight reduction in total cost (-3.0) in the previous round, indicating some improvement in route compactness. However, the improvement was minimal, suggesting the possibility of limited diminishing returns. Running another 10 steps will help assess whether further reductions in cost and route overlap are achievable. If the improvement remains negligible, transitioning to `three_opt_e8d7`, which explores more complex route refinements, should be considered. This step is intended to validate the potential of `two_opt_0554` for further optimization before switching to a more intensive refinement heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 9---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic has shown minimal improvements in the last two rounds, with a negligible reduction in total cost (-3.0 and 0.0). This suggests diminishing returns, and further iterations are unlikely to yield significant gains. The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic, being more comprehensive and capable of exploring complex route refinements, is better suited for this stage to achieve further cost reductions and route improvements. Running it for 10 steps allows us to evaluate its effectiveness without incurring excessive computational cost.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: -3.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 10---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is more comprehensive than `two_opt_0554` and explores complex route refinements. Given the minimal improvement from `two_opt_0554` in the last few rounds, transitioning to `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical step for further optimization. Since the current solution is valid and has room for improvement in terms of cost and route compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for 10 steps will help evaluate its effectiveness in achieving these goals. This is a conservative step to gauge the potential of this heuristic without incurring excessive computational cost.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 11---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is more comprehensive and capable of exploring complex route refinements, which is especially relevant given the minimal improvements from `two_opt_0554` in the previous rounds. The current state shows room for improvement in terms of total cost and route compactness, and `three_opt_e8d7` is well-suited for this stage of optimization. Running for another 10 steps will help evaluate its effectiveness in achieving further cost reduction and refinement without incurring excessive computational overhead.

---Round 12---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has demonstrated its potential for advanced route refinement, even though the previous rounds showed minimal improvements in cost reduction. Given the current state of the solution, where the routes are valid but still suboptimal in cost and compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for an extended number of steps (20 instead of 10) will allow for a more thorough exploration of route optimization. This step is aimed at achieving meaningful cost reductions and route improvements, especially since the diminishing returns observed in `two_opt_0554` suggest that a more comprehensive heuristic like `three_opt_e8d7` is necessary.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 0
Delta of Current Cost: 0.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 0
---Round 13---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is designed for advanced route refinement and is capable of exploring complex route improvements. While the last few rounds showed no significant cost reductions, this is likely due to insufficient exploration. Given the current state of the solution, where routes are valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for another 20 steps will provide an opportunity for deeper optimization. This extended run will allow for a more thorough exploration of potential improvements and help determine whether further progress can be made using this heuristic. If no significant improvements are observed, we may consider transitioning to another heuristic or halting further refinement.

---Round 14---
Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is designed for advanced route refinement and is capable of exploring complex route improvements. Although the last few rounds showed no significant cost reductions, this could be due to insufficient exploration. The current solution is valid but remains suboptimal in terms of cost and route compactness. Running another 20 steps will allow for deeper optimization and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its potential. If no significant improvements are observed after this, we should consider halting further refinement or transitioning to another heuristic.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: three_opt_e8d7. How does three_opt_e8d7 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: three_opt_e8d7  
running steps: 20  
hype parameter(optional):  
explanation: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic has been applied in the previous rounds but has not shown significant improvements due to potentially insufficient exploration or diminishing returns. Given the current solution state, where routes are valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and compactness, running another 20 steps will allow for deeper exploration of route optimization. This step will help determine if further cost reductions and route improvements are achievable. If no substantial progress is observed after this round, it may indicate that the solution is nearing its optimal state, and further refinement using this heuristic may not be worthwhile.***
