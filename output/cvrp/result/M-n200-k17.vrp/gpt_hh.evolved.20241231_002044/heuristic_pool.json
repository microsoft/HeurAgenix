Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic may perform best, along with quantifiable metrics that can guide their applicability:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances with a high number of nodes and when the goal is to create compact routes with a balance between cost and capacity utilization.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for moderate to large-scale instances (e.g., >50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Variability**: Performs better when demands are moderately dispersed.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Effective when nodes are unevenly distributed in space (e.g., clusters of nodes with sparse regions in between).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces relatively compact routes.\n     - Periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps enhance solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computational cost increases with the number of nodes due to scoring mechanism and periodic improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where computational efficiency is critical, such as large-scale problems or real-time decision-making.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs efficiently on large-scale instances (e.g., >100 nodes).\n     - **Time Constraint**: Suitable when solution time is a key constraint (e.g., must generate a solution within seconds or minutes).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Optimized for speed and simplicity while maintaining solution quality.\n     - Handles capacity constraints effectively.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not produce the most compact routes compared to other heuristics.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n   - **Scenario**: Works best for small to medium-sized instances where the primary goal is to build routes quickly, such as in routing problems with a lower number of nodes.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on small-to-medium problems (e.g., <50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Density**: Effective when demands are uniform or when higher-demand nodes are critical to prioritize.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Performs well when nodes are evenly distributed in space.\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Quick to compute and simple to implement.\n     - Incorporates 2-opt to improve route compactness.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Can lead to suboptimal solutions for larger or more complex instances.\n     - May generate longer routes due to its greedy nature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**\n   - **Scenario**: Best suited for problems with a small-to-moderate number of vehicles and when there is significant potential for route merging to reduce costs.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on medium-scale problems (e.g., 30\u2013100 nodes).\n     - **Vehicle Count**: Effective when the number of vehicles is small-to-moderate (e.g., <10 vehicles).\n     - **Merge Threshold**: Higher merge thresholds are better when merging routes is more cost-effective (e.g., when nodes are geographically dispersed).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces cost-efficient routes by merging routes with the highest savings.\n     - Accounts for vehicle capacity constraints during merging.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May struggle with very large instances or instances with highly constrained capacities.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for refining solutions to achieve high-quality routes, especially when the initial solution is already near optimal. Best used as a post-processing step.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-medium-sized instances (e.g., <100 nodes), but computational cost increases significantly with node count.\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: More effective when the initial solution is of moderate quality (e.g., routes are not highly fragmented).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces highly optimized routes by considering multiple segment reversals.\n     - Can significantly reduce route costs in some cases.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computationally expensive, especially for larger problems.\n     - Requires a good initial solution to be effective.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to `three_opt_e8d7`, this heuristic is best used for refining solutions, but it is computationally less intensive and can be applied to larger instances.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-large instances (e.g., 30\u2013500 nodes).\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: Effective when the initial solution is suboptimal (e.g., routes are long and overlapping).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Simple and computationally efficient compared to 3-opt.\n     - Can be applied iteratively to improve solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not achieve the same level of optimization as 3-opt for small problems.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Heuristic               | Node Count   | Vehicle Count | Demand Variability | Geographic Spread | Use Case                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308` | >50          | Any           | Moderate           | Uneven            | Compact routes with balanced cost and capacity utilization.              |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` | >100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | Large-scale problems requiring fast solutions.                           |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`   | <50          | Any           | Uniform/High       | Even              | Small-to-medium problems with quick computation needs.                   |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e`   | 30\u2013100       | <10           | Any                | Dispersed         | Medium-scale problems with significant potential for route merging.      |\n| `three_opt_e8d7`          | <100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | High-quality route refinement as a post-processing step.                 |\n| `two_opt_0554`            | 30\u2013500       | Any           | Any                | Any               | General-purpose route refinement for small-to-large problems.            |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Use **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`** or **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`** for quickly generating initial solutions.\n- Apply **`two_opt_0554`** or **`three_opt_e8d7`** for refining solutions to reduce costs further.\n- Use **`farthest_insertion_6308`** or **`saving_algorithm_710e`** when compact routes or cost-efficient merging is critical."
