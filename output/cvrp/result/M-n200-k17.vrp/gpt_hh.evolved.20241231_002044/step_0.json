Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic may perform best, along with quantifiable metrics that can guide their applicability:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances with a high number of nodes and when the goal is to create compact routes with a balance between cost and capacity utilization.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for moderate to large-scale instances (e.g., >50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Variability**: Performs better when demands are moderately dispersed.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Effective when nodes are unevenly distributed in space (e.g., clusters of nodes with sparse regions in between).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces relatively compact routes.\n     - Periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps enhance solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computational cost increases with the number of nodes due to scoring mechanism and periodic improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where computational efficiency is critical, such as large-scale problems or real-time decision-making.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs efficiently on large-scale instances (e.g., >100 nodes).\n     - **Time Constraint**: Suitable when solution time is a key constraint (e.g., must generate a solution within seconds or minutes).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Optimized for speed and simplicity while maintaining solution quality.\n     - Handles capacity constraints effectively.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not produce the most compact routes compared to other heuristics.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n   - **Scenario**: Works best for small to medium-sized instances where the primary goal is to build routes quickly, such as in routing problems with a lower number of nodes.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on small-to-medium problems (e.g., <50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Density**: Effective when demands are uniform or when higher-demand nodes are critical to prioritize.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Performs well when nodes are evenly distributed in space.\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Quick to compute and simple to implement.\n     - Incorporates 2-opt to improve route compactness.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Can lead to suboptimal solutions for larger or more complex instances.\n     - May generate longer routes due to its greedy nature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**\n   - **Scenario**: Best suited for problems with a small-to-moderate number of vehicles and when there is significant potential for route merging to reduce costs.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on medium-scale problems (e.g., 30\u2013100 nodes).\n     - **Vehicle Count**: Effective when the number of vehicles is small-to-moderate (e.g., <10 vehicles).\n     - **Merge Threshold**: Higher merge thresholds are better when merging routes is more cost-effective (e.g., when nodes are geographically dispersed).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces cost-efficient routes by merging routes with the highest savings.\n     - Accounts for vehicle capacity constraints during merging.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May struggle with very large instances or instances with highly constrained capacities.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for refining solutions to achieve high-quality routes, especially when the initial solution is already near optimal. Best used as a post-processing step.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-medium-sized instances (e.g., <100 nodes), but computational cost increases significantly with node count.\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: More effective when the initial solution is of moderate quality (e.g., routes are not highly fragmented).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces highly optimized routes by considering multiple segment reversals.\n     - Can significantly reduce route costs in some cases.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computationally expensive, especially for larger problems.\n     - Requires a good initial solution to be effective.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to `three_opt_e8d7`, this heuristic is best used for refining solutions, but it is computationally less intensive and can be applied to larger instances.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-large instances (e.g., 30\u2013500 nodes).\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: Effective when the initial solution is suboptimal (e.g., routes are long and overlapping).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Simple and computationally efficient compared to 3-opt.\n     - Can be applied iteratively to improve solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not achieve the same level of optimization as 3-opt for small problems.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Heuristic               | Node Count   | Vehicle Count | Demand Variability | Geographic Spread | Use Case                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308` | >50          | Any           | Moderate           | Uneven            | Compact routes with balanced cost and capacity utilization.              |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` | >100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | Large-scale problems requiring fast solutions.                           |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`   | <50          | Any           | Uniform/High       | Even              | Small-to-medium problems with quick computation needs.                   |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e`   | 30\u2013100       | <10           | Any                | Dispersed         | Medium-scale problems with significant potential for route merging.      |\n| `three_opt_e8d7`          | <100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | High-quality route refinement as a post-processing step.                 |\n| `two_opt_0554`            | 30\u2013500       | Any           | Any                | Any               | General-purpose route refinement for small-to-large problems.            |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Use **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`** or **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`** for quickly generating initial solutions.\n- Apply **`two_opt_0554`** or **`three_opt_e8d7`** for refining solutions to reduce costs further.\n- Use **`farthest_insertion_6308`** or **`saving_algorithm_710e`** when compact routes or cost-efficient merging is critical."

How does None perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for initializing solutions quickly, especially in small steps. Since the demands and distances are moderate, this heuristic can provide a quick starting point by prioritizing nodes that fit vehicle capacities while minimizing initial route costs. After 10 steps, we can assess the quality of the initial solution and decide whether to continue or switch heuristics.  \n***"
