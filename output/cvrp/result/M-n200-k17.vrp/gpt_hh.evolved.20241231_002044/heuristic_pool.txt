I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.

***is_cop:yes***  

Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves searching through a discrete solution space (possible routes for vehicles) to find an optimal solution that minimizes a cost function (e.g., total distance or cost) while satisfying constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity, visiting all customers, and returning to the depot).  

The solution framework, operator definitions, and heuristic function signature you provided are well-aligned with addressing such problems using heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches. CVRP is a classic example where heuristics like those facilitated by your operators (e.g., Append, Insert, Swap, etc.) are frequently used to iteratively improve solutions.  

Analysis outside ***: None of the provided elements (Solution, Operators, Data structures) seem incorrect or out of place for this context.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To determine the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable, we need to consider the characteristics of the problem instance, such as the number of nodes, vehicle capacity, demand distribution, and geographic distribution of the nodes. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic may perform best, along with quantifiable metrics that can guide their applicability:

---

### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances with a high number of nodes and when the goal is to create compact routes with a balance between cost and capacity utilization.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for moderate to large-scale instances (e.g., >50 nodes).
     - **Demand Variability**: Performs better when demands are moderately dispersed.
     - **Geographic Spread**: Effective when nodes are unevenly distributed in space (e.g., clusters of nodes with sparse regions in between).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces relatively compact routes.
     - Periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps enhance solution quality.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computational cost increases with the number of nodes due to scoring mechanism and periodic improvements.

---

### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where computational efficiency is critical, such as large-scale problems or real-time decision-making.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs efficiently on large-scale instances (e.g., >100 nodes).
     - **Time Constraint**: Suitable when solution time is a key constraint (e.g., must generate a solution within seconds or minutes).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Optimized for speed and simplicity while maintaining solution quality.
     - Handles capacity constraints effectively.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May not produce the most compact routes compared to other heuristics.

---

### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**
   - **Scenario**: Works best for small to medium-sized instances where the primary goal is to build routes quickly, such as in routing problems with a lower number of nodes.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs well on small-to-medium problems (e.g., <50 nodes).
     - **Demand Density**: Effective when demands are uniform or when higher-demand nodes are critical to prioritize.
     - **Geographic Spread**: Performs well when nodes are evenly distributed in space.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Quick to compute and simple to implement.
     - Incorporates 2-opt to improve route compactness.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Can lead to suboptimal solutions for larger or more complex instances.
     - May generate longer routes due to its greedy nature.

---

### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for problems with a small-to-moderate number of vehicles and when there is significant potential for route merging to reduce costs.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Performs well on medium-scale problems (e.g., 30â100 nodes).
     - **Vehicle Count**: Effective when the number of vehicles is small-to-moderate (e.g., <10 vehicles).
     - **Merge Threshold**: Higher merge thresholds are better when merging routes is more cost-effective (e.g., when nodes are geographically dispersed).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces cost-efficient routes by merging routes with the highest savings.
     - Accounts for vehicle capacity constraints during merging.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May struggle with very large instances or instances with highly constrained capacities.

---

### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for refining solutions to achieve high-quality routes, especially when the initial solution is already near optimal. Best used as a post-processing step.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-medium-sized instances (e.g., <100 nodes), but computational cost increases significantly with node count.
     - **Initial Solution Quality**: More effective when the initial solution is of moderate quality (e.g., routes are not highly fragmented).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Produces highly optimized routes by considering multiple segment reversals.
     - Can significantly reduce route costs in some cases.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computationally expensive, especially for larger problems.
     - Requires a good initial solution to be effective.

---

### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**
   - **Scenario**: Similar to `three_opt_e8d7`, this heuristic is best used for refining solutions, but it is computationally less intensive and can be applied to larger instances.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:
     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-large instances (e.g., 30â500 nodes).
     - **Initial Solution Quality**: Effective when the initial solution is suboptimal (e.g., routes are long and overlapping).
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple and computationally efficient compared to 3-opt.
     - Can be applied iteratively to improve solution quality.
   - **Limitations**:
     - May not achieve the same level of optimization as 3-opt for small problems.

### Recommendations:
- Use **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`** or **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`** for quickly generating initial solutions.
- Apply **`two_opt_0554`** or **`three_opt_e8d7`** for refining solutions to reduce costs further.
- Use **`farthest_insertion_6308`** or **`saving_algorithm_710e`** when compact routes or cost-efficient merging is critical.
