Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic may perform best, along with quantifiable metrics that can guide their applicability:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`farthest_insertion_6308`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for instances with a high number of nodes and when the goal is to create compact routes with a balance between cost and capacity utilization.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for moderate to large-scale instances (e.g., >50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Variability**: Performs better when demands are moderately dispersed.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Effective when nodes are unevenly distributed in space (e.g., clusters of nodes with sparse regions in between).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces relatively compact routes.\n     - Periodic greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps enhance solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computational cost increases with the number of nodes due to scoring mechanism and periodic improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for instances where computational efficiency is critical, such as large-scale problems or real-time decision-making.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs efficiently on large-scale instances (e.g., >100 nodes).\n     - **Time Constraint**: Suitable when solution time is a key constraint (e.g., must generate a solution within seconds or minutes).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Optimized for speed and simplicity while maintaining solution quality.\n     - Handles capacity constraints effectively.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not produce the most compact routes compared to other heuristics.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`**\n   - **Scenario**: Works best for small to medium-sized instances where the primary goal is to build routes quickly, such as in routing problems with a lower number of nodes.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on small-to-medium problems (e.g., <50 nodes).\n     - **Demand Density**: Effective when demands are uniform or when higher-demand nodes are critical to prioritize.\n     - **Geographic Spread**: Performs well when nodes are evenly distributed in space.\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Quick to compute and simple to implement.\n     - Incorporates 2-opt to improve route compactness.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Can lead to suboptimal solutions for larger or more complex instances.\n     - May generate longer routes due to its greedy nature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`saving_algorithm_710e`**\n   - **Scenario**: Best suited for problems with a small-to-moderate number of vehicles and when there is significant potential for route merging to reduce costs.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Performs well on medium-scale problems (e.g., 30\u2013100 nodes).\n     - **Vehicle Count**: Effective when the number of vehicles is small-to-moderate (e.g., <10 vehicles).\n     - **Merge Threshold**: Higher merge thresholds are better when merging routes is more cost-effective (e.g., when nodes are geographically dispersed).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces cost-efficient routes by merging routes with the highest savings.\n     - Accounts for vehicle capacity constraints during merging.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May struggle with very large instances or instances with highly constrained capacities.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`three_opt_e8d7`**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for refining solutions to achieve high-quality routes, especially when the initial solution is already near optimal. Best used as a post-processing step.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-medium-sized instances (e.g., <100 nodes), but computational cost increases significantly with node count.\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: More effective when the initial solution is of moderate quality (e.g., routes are not highly fragmented).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Produces highly optimized routes by considering multiple segment reversals.\n     - Can significantly reduce route costs in some cases.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - Computationally expensive, especially for larger problems.\n     - Requires a good initial solution to be effective.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`two_opt_0554`**\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to `three_opt_e8d7`, this heuristic is best used for refining solutions, but it is computationally less intensive and can be applied to larger instances.\n   - **Quantifiable Metrics**:\n     - **Node Count**: Works well for small-to-large instances (e.g., 30\u2013500 nodes).\n     - **Initial Solution Quality**: Effective when the initial solution is suboptimal (e.g., routes are long and overlapping).\n   - **Advantages**:\n     - Simple and computationally efficient compared to 3-opt.\n     - Can be applied iteratively to improve solution quality.\n   - **Limitations**:\n     - May not achieve the same level of optimization as 3-opt for small problems.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Heuristic               | Node Count   | Vehicle Count | Demand Variability | Geographic Spread | Use Case                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `farthest_insertion_6308` | >50          | Any           | Moderate           | Uneven            | Compact routes with balanced cost and capacity utilization.              |\n| `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` | >100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | Large-scale problems requiring fast solutions.                           |\n| `nearest_neighbor_54a9`   | <50          | Any           | Uniform/High       | Even              | Small-to-medium problems with quick computation needs.                   |\n| `saving_algorithm_710e`   | 30\u2013100       | <10           | Any                | Dispersed         | Medium-scale problems with significant potential for route merging.      |\n| `three_opt_e8d7`          | <100         | Any           | Any                | Any               | High-quality route refinement as a post-processing step.                 |\n| `two_opt_0554`            | 30\u2013500       | Any           | Any                | Any               | General-purpose route refinement for small-to-large problems.            |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Use **`nearest_neighbor_54a9`** or **`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`** for quickly generating initial solutions.\n- Apply **`two_opt_0554`** or **`three_opt_e8d7`** for refining solutions to reduce costs further.\n- Use **`farthest_insertion_6308`** or **`saving_algorithm_710e`** when compact routes or cost-efficient merging is critical."

The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is well-suited for initializing solutions quickly, especially in small steps. Since the demands and distances are moderate, this heuristic can provide a quick starting point by prioritizing nodes that fit vehicle capacities while minimizing initial route costs. After 10 steps, we can assess the quality of the initial solution and decide whether to continue or switch heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 47.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 198\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution shows that only one vehicle is partially utilized, with a significant number of unvisited nodes (189) and a large remaining total demand (2988). Since the `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic performed reasonably well in the first round (adding 10 nodes and fulfilling 198 demands), it remains a good choice for further initialization of the solution. The heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on demand and proximity can continue to quickly construct routes while respecting vehicle capacities. Running for another 10 steps allows us to continue building the solution incrementally while monitoring progress.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 42.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 164\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution shows that progress is being made, with 21 nodes visited and a significant number of unvisited nodes (179) still remaining. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the previous two rounds, adding 10 nodes per round and fulfilling substantial demands (198 and 164, respectively). While the average remaining vehicle capacity is high (178.7), indicating that vehicles are underutilized, the heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on proximity and demand continues to be effective for incrementally building the solution. Running for another 10 steps allows further progress while maintaining a methodical approach to constructing the solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 50.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 148\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in the past three rounds, demonstrating the ability to incrementally construct the solution by adding 10 nodes per round while fulfilling substantial demands. Currently, there are still 169 unvisited nodes, and the vehicles have significant remaining capacities. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is effective for further initialization of the solution by prioritizing nodes with higher demands and proximity.

Currently, there are still 159 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (2477). The heuristic's prioritization of nodes with higher demands and proximity remains effective for further initialization of the solution.

While diminishing returns are evident (with fewer nodes added and lower demand fulfilled in recent rounds), it is still effective for constructing the solution incrementally. The current state shows 149 unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand (2378). Running the heuristic for another 10 steps will allow us to continue building the solution while monitoring its diminishing effectiveness.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 44.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 166\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been consistently effective in incrementally constructing the solution. While diminishing returns are becoming apparent, there are still 139 unvisited nodes and a significant remaining demand of 2212. This heuristic's prioritization of nodes based on proximity and demand makes it suitable for continuing the initialization process. Running for another 10 steps will allow us to assess its effectiveness further and decide whether to transition to a refinement heuristic like `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7` afterward.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 82.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 131\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in constructing the initial solution over multiple rounds, but diminishing returns are evident. The current solution's average route cost and total cost indicate room for improvement in route compactness. The `two_opt_0554` heuristic is well-suited for refining the solution by reducing route overlap and improving route efficiency. Running it for 10 steps will allow us to test its effectiveness in reducing the total cost while preserving the solution's validity. If successful, further refinement or transition to `three_opt_e8d7` can be considered.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -3.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: two_opt_0554\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic demonstrated a slight reduction in total cost (-3.0) in the previous round, indicating some improvement in route compactness. However, the improvement was minimal, suggesting the possibility of limited diminishing returns. Running another 10 steps will help assess whether further reductions in cost and route overlap are achievable. If the improvement remains negligible, transitioning to `three_opt_e8d7`, which explores more complex route refinements, should be considered. This step is intended to validate the potential of `two_opt_0554` for further optimization before switching to a more intensive refinement heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `two_opt_0554` heuristic has shown minimal improvements in the last two rounds, with a negligible reduction in total cost (-3.0 and 0.0). This suggests diminishing returns, and further iterations are unlikely to yield significant gains. The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic, being more comprehensive and capable of exploring complex route refinements, is better suited for this stage to achieve further cost reductions and route improvements. Running it for 10 steps allows us to evaluate its effectiveness without incurring excessive computational cost.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: -3.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is more comprehensive than `two_opt_0554` and explores complex route refinements. Given the minimal improvement from `two_opt_0554` in the last few rounds, transitioning to `three_opt_e8d7` is a logical step for further optimization. Since the current solution is valid and has room for improvement in terms of cost and route compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for 10 steps will help evaluate its effectiveness in achieving these goals. This is a conservative step to gauge the potential of this heuristic without incurring excessive computational cost.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is more comprehensive and capable of exploring complex route refinements, which is especially relevant given the minimal improvements from `two_opt_0554` in the previous rounds. The current state shows room for improvement in terms of total cost and route compactness, and `three_opt_e8d7` is well-suited for this stage of optimization.

Given the current state of the solution, where the routes are valid but still suboptimal in cost and compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for an extended number of steps (20 instead of 10) will allow for a more thorough exploration of route optimization. This step is aimed at achieving meaningful cost reductions and route improvements, especially since the diminishing returns observed in `two_opt_0554` suggest that a more comprehensive heuristic like `three_opt_e8d7` is necessary.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic is designed for advanced route refinement and is capable of exploring complex route improvements. While the last few rounds showed no significant cost reductions, this is likely due to insufficient exploration. Given the current state of the solution, where routes are valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and compactness, running the `three_opt_e8d7` heuristic for another 20 steps will provide an opportunity for deeper optimization. This extended run will allow for a more thorough exploration of potential improvements and help determine whether further progress can be made using this heuristic.

The current solution is valid but remains suboptimal in terms of cost and route compactness. Running another 20 steps will allow for deeper optimization and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its potential.

Given the current solution state, where routes are valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and compactness, running another 20 steps will allow for deeper exploration of route optimization. This step will help determine if further cost reductions and route improvements are achievable. If no substantial progress is observed after this round, it may indicate that the solution is nearing its optimal state, and further refinement using this heuristic may not be worthwhile.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 16---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The last few rounds of applying `three_opt_e8d7` have not shown significant cost reductions, but this could be due to insufficient exploration rather than the heuristic's lack of potential. The current solution, while valid, is still suboptimal in terms of cost and route compactness. Running another 20 steps will allow for deeper exploration of complex route refinements. This extended run will help determine whether further improvements can be achieved or if the solution is nearing its optimal state.

Although recent rounds have shown no substantial cost reduction, this could be due to insufficient exploration or the complexity of the problem. The current solution is valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and compactness, with unvisited nodes and significant remaining demand.

While recent rounds have shown no significant cost reduction, this could be due to insufficient exploration or the complexity of the current solution space. Extending the number of steps to 30 provides a deeper exploration of possible refinements and increases the likelihood of uncovering meaningful improvements. Since the current solution is valid but still suboptimal in terms of cost and route compactness, this heuristic remains the most suitable for further refinement at this stage.

Extending the exploration for another 30 steps provides a final opportunity to exhaust the potential of this heuristic before considering alternative strategies or halting refinement. This step will help conclusively determine if further progress can be achieved using `three_opt_e8d7`.\n***"
