I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:

        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. The framework you've built, which includes solutions, operators, and a standardized heuristic function signature, appears to be well-suited for tackling CVRP using hyper-heuristics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,insertion_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,inter_route_heuristics,metaheuristic_inspired

construction_heuristics: suitable for quickly building initial feasible solutions from scratch by sequentially adding nodes to routes
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

insertion_heuristics: focus on inserting nodes into existing routes in a way that minimizes cost or maximizes route efficiency
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.

improvement_heuristics: aim to refine existing solutions by systematically exploring local changes to reduce cost or improve route compactness
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

inter_route_heuristics: focus on moving nodes between different routes or merging routes to improve overall solution quality
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.

metaheuristic_inspired: use principles from metaheuristics to escape local optima and explore diverse solutions
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Creating a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each category and knowing when to switch between them. Here is a proposed strategy:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective:** Quickly build a feasible solution that can be improved upon.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Construction Heuristics:** Begin with these to create an initial solution. They are fast and provide a baseline to work from.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Start with `greedy_f4c4()` to construct an initial solution based on proximity.
      2. Use `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` to enhance the initial solution, especially when dealing with high-demand nodes.
      3. Briefly test `random_bfdc()` to introduce variability in the initial solution and assess if randomness leads to better starting points.
  - **Insertion Heuristics:** After constructing a basic solution, use these to refine it.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Apply `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()` to reduce initial costs by optimizing node placements.
      2. Use `farthest_insertion_6308()` to strategically insert nodes and enhance route compactness.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
- **Objective:** Refine the initial solution to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Improvement Heuristics:** Focus on systematic local changes to enhance the solution.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Implement `two_opt_0554()` and `three_opt_e8d7()` sequentially to explore potential improvements in route paths.
      2. If local optimizations plateau, use `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` to explore new neighborhoods and escape local optima.
  - **Inter-Route Heuristics:** Use these when intra-route improvements are insufficient.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Apply `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()` to explore benefits from moving nodes between routes.
      2. Test `saving_algorithm_710e()` for potential route merges that maintain capacity constraints.

#### Phase 3: Metaheuristic-Inspired Exploration
- **Objective:** Escape local optima and explore diverse solutions.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Metaheuristic-Inspired:** Use these to diversify search and discover potentially unexplored solutions.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Revisit `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` with modified parameters to further explore solution space.

### Iterative Approach
- **Assess and Adapt:** After each phase, evaluate the solution's performance using metrics such as total cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization.
- **Switching Strategy:** If a heuristic shows diminishing returns, consider switching to another category or revisiting a previously used heuristic with different parameters.
- **Experimentation:** Periodically test different combinations of heuristics to identify synergies and discover effective strategies.

### Goal
- **Balanced Exploration and Exploitation:** Alternate between different heuristics during construction and improvement phases to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the solution space.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Allow for iterative refinement, using feedback from each phase to guide subsequent heuristic choices.

This strategic guide aims to provide a structured approach to heuristic selection, promoting flexibility and adaptability in solving the CVRP.

Before this discuss, we have already 14 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since the current solution is essentially empty with no nodes visited apart from the depot, it is crucial to construct an initial feasible solution. Starting with construction heuristics will quickly build a baseline solution from which further improvements can be made. Using a construction heuristic like `greedy_f4c4()` or `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` will help fill in the routes and utilize the vehicle capacity effectively, setting the stage for further optimization.
Visited Node Num: 1->2
Current Cost: 0.0->38.0
Fulfilled Demands: 0->18
---Round 1---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution is still in its initial stages with only two nodes visited and a very low vehicle load utilization. Continuing with the construction heuristics will help further develop the routes and increase the number of nodes visited. Using construction heuristics like `greedy_f4c4()` or `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` will help fill more routes effectively before transitioning to refinement and optimization phases.
Visited Node Num: 2->3
Current Cost: 38.0->66.0
Fulfilled Demands: 18->48
---Round 2---
Heuristic: random_bfdc
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution is still in the early stages of development, with a significant number of nodes unvisited and low vehicle load utilization. Continuing with construction heuristics will help expand the current solution by adding more nodes to the routes and improving vehicle capacity utilization. This will establish a more robust foundation before transitioning to other heuristic categories for optimization. Given the high number of unvisited nodes, it's crucial to continue building the solution with construction heuristics to cover more ground efficiently.
Visited Node Num: 3->4
Current Cost: 66.0->67.0
Fulfilled Demands: 48->119
---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current solution is still in its early stages, with only 4 nodes visited and a significant number of nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will help expand the solution by adding more nodes to the routes, thereby increasing vehicle load utilization and covering more ground efficiently. This approach will further develop the foundation before transitioning to refinement and optimization phases. Once a more substantial portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for optimization.
Visited Node Num: 4->5
Current Cost: 67.0->106.0
Fulfilled Demands: 119->345
---Round 4---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution is still in its early stages, with only 5 nodes visited out of 135. It is important to continue building the solution to cover more ground efficiently. Construction heuristics are suitable for quickly expanding the solution by adding more nodes to the routes. Once a more substantial portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to other heuristic categories for optimization and refinement.
Visited Node Num: 5->6
Current Cost: 106.0->114.0

---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution is still in the early stages, with a large number of nodes unvisited and low vehicle capacity utilization. Continuing with construction heuristics will help further develop the solution by adding more nodes to the routes, increasing vehicle load utilization, and establishing a more robust foundation. Once a more substantial portion of nodes is included in the routes, we can then consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for optimization.
Visited Node Num: 6->7
Current Cost: 114.0->124.0
Fulfilled Demands: 382->406
---Round 6---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current solution is still in the early stages, with a very small portion of nodes visited (7 out of 135), indicating that the solution is far from complete. Continuing with construction heuristics will help in covering more nodes and establishing a more comprehensive initial solution. The focus should remain on building a more substantial foundation before transitioning to other heuristic categories for optimization. This approach will ensure that a more significant portion of the solution space is explored before refining or improving the solution further.
Visited Node Num: 7->8
Current Cost: 124.0->127.0
Fulfilled Demands: 406->442
---Round 7---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The current solution is still in the early stages with only 8 nodes visited out of 135. Given the large number of unvisited nodes and low vehicle load utilization, it's crucial to continue building the solution to cover more nodes and improve vehicle capacity utilization. Continuing with construction heuristics will help establish a more comprehensive initial solution before transitioning to other heuristic categories for optimization. Once a significant portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for further refinement.

Continuing with construction heuristics is crucial to further develop the solution by covering more nodes and improving vehicle capacity utilization. This will help establish a more robust foundation before transitioning to other heuristic categories for optimization and refinement.

Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: construction_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Although some progress has been made with 10 nodes visited, the solution is still in its early stages with 125 nodes remaining unvisited. Continuing with construction heuristics will help further develop the initial solution by incorporating more nodes into the routes. Given the low vehicle load utilization and a large number of unvisited nodes, continuing to build the solution is crucial before transitioning to more advanced optimization techniques. Once a more substantial portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for further optimization.

Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Heuristic Category: insertion_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has started to take shape, with 11 out of 135 nodes visited and a significant number of nodes still unvisited. The vehicle load utilization is relatively low, and many routes are underutilized. Continuing with construction heuristics may not yield significant improvements at this stage. Switching to insertion heuristics can help by strategically placing unvisited nodes into existing routes to optimize the current solution, improve vehicle load utilization, and minimize costs. This category will allow for a more refined approach, enhancing the current solution by focusing on cost-effective node placements.

Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Heuristic Category: insertion_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution is still in its development phase with a significant number of unvisited nodes (123 out of 135). The previous use of an insertion heuristic, specifically `farthest_insertion_6308`, suggests that strategic node placements have been beneficial in optimizing the solution. Continuing with insertion heuristics can further refine node placements by focusing on cost-effective insertion and improving vehicle load utilization. This approach will help integrate more unvisited nodes into existing routes, enhancing the overall solution quality before considering inter-route improvements or metaheuristic strategies.

Heuristic: three_opt_e8d7
Heuristic Category: improvement_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has a moderate number of nodes visited, but there are still 123 unvisited nodes, and vehicle capacity utilization can be improved. Switching to improvement heuristics such as 2-opt or 3-opt can help refine the existing routes by exploring local changes that reduce costs and improve route compactness. This approach will enhance the current solution's efficiency and potentially make room for further node insertions by optimizing the existing routes.

Heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a
Heuristic Category: inter_route_heuristics
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has made some progress with a moderate number of nodes visited and a valid solution. However, there is still a significant number of unvisited nodes (122 out of 135), and many vehicles are underutilized. Switching to inter-route heuristics can help optimize the current solution by moving nodes between routes or merging routes to improve overall solution quality. This approach can enhance route efficiency and better utilize vehicle capacity, providing a more balanced and cost-effective solution before returning to improvement or metaheuristic strategies.

explanation:The current solution has a moderate number of nodes visited, but a significant number of nodes remain unvisited (122 out of 135), and many vehicles are underutilized. Continuing with inter-route heuristics may not yield substantial improvements at this stage. Switching to insertion heuristics can help by strategically placing unvisited nodes into existing routes to optimize the current solution and improve vehicle load utilization. This approach will focus on cost-effective node placements, enhancing the overall solution quality before returning to improvement or metaheuristic strategies.
