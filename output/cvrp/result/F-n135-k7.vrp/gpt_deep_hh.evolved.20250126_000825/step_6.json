Here is a proposed strategy:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n- **Objective:** Quickly build a feasible solution that can be improved upon.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Construction Heuristics:** Begin with these to create an initial solution. They are fast and provide a baseline to work from.\n    - **Execution Steps:**\n      1. Start with `greedy_f4c4()` to construct an initial solution based on proximity.\n      2. Use `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` to enhance the initial solution, especially when dealing with high-demand nodes.\n      3. Briefly test `random_bfdc()` to introduce variability in the initial solution and assess if randomness leads to better starting points.\n  - **Insertion Heuristics:** After constructing a basic solution, use these to refine it.\n    - **Execution Steps:**\n      1. Apply `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()` to reduce initial costs by optimizing node placements.\n      2. Use `farthest_insertion_6308()` to strategically insert nodes and enhance route compactness.\n\n#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement\n- **Objective:** Refine the initial solution to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Improvement Heuristics:** Focus on systematic local changes to enhance the solution.\n    - **Execution Steps:**\n      1. Implement `two_opt_0554()` and `three_opt_e8d7()` sequentially to explore potential improvements in route paths.\n      2. If local optimizations plateau, use `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` to explore new neighborhoods and escape local optima.\n  - **Inter-Route Heuristics:** Use these when intra-route improvements are insufficient.\n    - **Execution Steps:**\n      1. Apply `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()` to explore benefits from moving nodes between routes.\n      2. Test `saving_algorithm_710e()` for potential route merges that maintain capacity constraints.\n\n#### Phase 3: Metaheuristic-Inspired Exploration\n- **Objective:** Escape local optima and explore diverse solutions.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Metaheuristic-Inspired:** Use these to diversify search and discover potentially unexplored solutions.\n    - **Execution Steps:**\n      1. Revisit `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` with modified parameters to further explore solution space.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Assess and Adapt:** After each phase, evaluate the solution's performance using metrics such as total cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization.\n- **Switching Strategy:** If a heuristic shows diminishing returns, consider switching to another category or revisiting a previously used heuristic with different parameters.\n- **Experimentation:** Periodically test different combinations of heuristics to identify synergies and discover effective strategies.\n\n### Goal\n- **Balanced Exploration and Exploitation:** Alternate between different heuristics during construction and improvement phases to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the solution space.\n- **Iterative Improvement:** Allow for iterative refinement, using feedback from each phase to guide subsequent heuristic choices.\n\nThis strategic guide aims to provide a structured approach to heuristic selection, promoting flexibility and adaptability in solving the CVRP."

Continuing with construction heuristics will help expand the current solution by adding more nodes to the routes and improving vehicle capacity utilization. This will establish a more robust foundation before transitioning to other heuristic categories for optimization.

Once a more substantial portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for optimization.\nVisited Node Num: 4->5\nCurrent Cost: 67.0->106.0\nFulfilled Demands: 119->345\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution is still in its early stages, with only 5 nodes visited out of 135. It is important to continue building the solution to cover more ground efficiently. Construction heuristics are suitable for quickly expanding the solution by adding more nodes to the routes. Once a more substantial portion of the nodes is included in the routes, we can consider switching to other heuristic categories for optimization and refinement.\nVisited Node Num: 5->6\nCurrent Cost: 106.0->114.0\nFulfilled Demands: 345->382\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: construction_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution is still in the early stages, with a large number of nodes unvisited and low vehicle capacity utilization. Continuing with construction heuristics will help further develop the solution by adding more nodes to the routes, increasing vehicle load utilization, and establishing a more robust foundation. Once a more substantial portion of nodes is included in the routes, we can then consider switching to insertion or improvement heuristics for optimization.\nVisited Node Num: 6->7\nCurrent Cost: 114.0->124.0\nFulfilled Demands: 382->406\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nvehicle_0: 0->1->2->3->4->0\nvehicle_1: 0->0\nvehicle_2: 0->0\nvehicle_3: 0->0\nvehicle_4: 0->0\nvehicle_5: 0->50->23->0\nvehicle_6: 0->0\n\nvisited_nodes:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 50, 23]\nvisited_num:7\nunvisited_nodes:[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]\nunvisited_num:128\ntotal_current_cost:124.0\nlast_visited:[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 23, 0]\nvehicle_loads:[317, 0, 0, 0, 0, 89, 0]\nvehicle_remaining_capacity:[1893, 2210, 2210, 2210, 2210, 2121, 2210]\naverage_route_length:1.8571428571428572\nmax_route_length:5\nmin_route_length:1\nstd_dev_route_length:1.456862718169367\naverage_route_cost:41.0\ntotal_demand_served:406\naverage_vehicle_load:58.0\naverage_remaining_vehicle_capacity:2152.0\nnumber_of_unvisited_nodes:128\naverage_unvisited_node_demand:111.046875\ntotal_remaining_demand:14214\nsolution_validity:True\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: nearest_neighbor_54a9(construction_heuristics).
