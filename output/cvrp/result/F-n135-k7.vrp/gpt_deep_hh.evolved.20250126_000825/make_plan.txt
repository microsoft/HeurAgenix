I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        target_depot_index = solution.routes[self.target_vehicle_id].index(solution.depot)
        merge_route = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id][source_depot_index + 1:] + new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id][:source_depot_index] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id][target_depot_index + 1:] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id][:target_depot_index]
        new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot] + merge_route + [solution.depot]
        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): The current set of routes for all vehicles.
    - "visited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of lists representing the nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes visited by each vehicle.
    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.
    - "visited_num" (int): Number of nodes have not been visited by each vehicle.
    - "total_current_cost" (int): The total cost of the current solution.
    - "last_visited" (list[int]): The last visited node for each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_loads" (list[int]): The current load of each vehicle.
    - "vehicle_remaining_capacity" (list[int]): The remaining capacity for each vehicle.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively approached using heuristic methods. The framework you've built, which includes solutions, operators, and a standardized heuristic function signature, appears to be well-suited for tackling CVRP using hyper-heuristics.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): construction_heuristics,insertion_heuristics,improvement_heuristics,inter_route_heuristics,metaheuristic_inspired

construction_heuristics: suitable for quickly building initial feasible solutions from scratch by sequentially adding nodes to routes
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

insertion_heuristics: focus on inserting nodes into existing routes in a way that minimizes cost or maximizes route efficiency
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.

improvement_heuristics: aim to refine existing solutions by systematically exploring local changes to reduce cost or improve route compactness
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

inter_route_heuristics: focus on moving nodes between different routes or merging routes to improve overall solution quality
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.

metaheuristic_inspired: use principles from metaheuristics to escape local optima and explore diverse solutions
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

demands:[0, 30, 226, 37, 24, 36, 1, 31, 24, 30, 24, 24, 32, 24, 24, 19, 24, 18, 36, 115, 24, 24, 61, 71, 36, 18, 30, 31, 36, 18, 1004, 18, 34, 504, 18, 39, 24, 37, 24, 99, 24, 24, 36, 30, 25, 24, 122, 196, 229, 83, 18, 24, 306, 18, 20, 18, 24, 22, 24, 18, 18, 24, 24, 30, 24, 40, 166, 254, 187, 94, 17, 285, 24, 24, 205, 23, 28, 51, 49, 19, 262, 120, 266, 704, 38, 18, 30, 25, 12, 18, 25, 35, 18, 12, 20, 1126, 9, 36, 12, 31, 96, 27, 54, 137, 12, 58, 206, 178, 486, 36, 261, 135, 135, 373, 535, 42, 9, 110, 36, 18, 726, 187, 23, 134, 47, 51, 43, 79, 112, 91, 232, 483, 828, 11, 12]

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Creating a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each category and knowing when to switch between them. Here is a proposed strategy:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective:** Quickly build a feasible solution that can be improved upon.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Construction Heuristics:** Begin with these to create an initial solution. They are fast and provide a baseline to work from.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Start with `greedy_f4c4()` to construct an initial solution based on proximity.
      2. Use `nearest_neighbor_54a9()` to enhance the initial solution, especially when dealing with high-demand nodes.
      3. Briefly test `random_bfdc()` to introduce variability in the initial solution and assess if randomness leads to better starting points.
  - **Insertion Heuristics:** After constructing a basic solution, use these to refine it.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Apply `min_cost_insertion_3b2b()` to reduce initial costs by optimizing node placements.
      2. Use `farthest_insertion_6308()` to strategically insert nodes and enhance route compactness.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
- **Objective:** Refine the initial solution to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Improvement Heuristics:** Focus on systematic local changes to enhance the solution.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Implement `two_opt_0554()` and `three_opt_e8d7()` sequentially to explore potential improvements in route paths.
      2. If local optimizations plateau, use `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` to explore new neighborhoods and escape local optima.
  - **Inter-Route Heuristics:** Use these when intra-route improvements are insufficient.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Apply `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()` to explore benefits from moving nodes between routes.
      2. Test `saving_algorithm_710e()` for potential route merges that maintain capacity constraints.

#### Phase 3: Metaheuristic-Inspired Exploration
- **Objective:** Escape local optima and explore diverse solutions.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Metaheuristic-Inspired:** Use these to diversify search and discover potentially unexplored solutions.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      1. Revisit `variable_neighborhood_search_614b()` with modified parameters to further explore solution space.

### Iterative Approach
- **Assess and Adapt:** After each phase, evaluate the solution's performance using metrics such as total cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization.
- **Switching Strategy:** If a heuristic shows diminishing returns, consider switching to another category or revisiting a previously used heuristic with different parameters.
- **Experimentation:** Periodically test different combinations of heuristics to identify synergies and discover effective strategies.

### Goal
- **Balanced Exploration and Exploitation:** Alternate between different heuristics during construction and improvement phases to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the solution space.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Allow for iterative refinement, using feedback from each phase to guide subsequent heuristic choices.

This strategic guide aims to provide a structured approach to heuristic selection, promoting flexibility and adaptability in solving the CVRP.
