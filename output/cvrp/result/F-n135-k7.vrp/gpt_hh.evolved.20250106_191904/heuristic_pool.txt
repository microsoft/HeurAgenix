I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): Nodes that have not yet been visited by any vehicle.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be effectively addressed using heuristic methods. The solution and operator framework you have described is consistent with common approaches for tackling such problems, where different operators are used to explore the solution space and improve upon existing solutions. The use of heuristics is a standard practice in solving CVRP due to its NP-hard nature, making exact solutions computationally expensive for large instances.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

When working with heuristic algorithms for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), it's essential to understand the specific scenarios where each heuristic might perform optimally. Here's an analysis of each algorithm and the situations where they are most applicable:

1. **farthest_insertion_6308()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when you have a diverse set of nodes with varying distances from the depot. It is particularly effective in instances where there are clusters of nodes far from the starting point.
   - **Best Quantified By**: High variance in node distances and when the problem size (number of nodes) is moderate to large. It can help in quickly generating a feasible initial solution by focusing on the outermost nodes and gradually building inwards.

2. **min_cost_insertion_3b2b()**:
   - **Scenario**: This approach is suitable for scenarios where cost efficiency is paramount, and the primary objective is to minimize the travel cost rather than just finding a feasible route.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Situations where the distance matrix has varying costs and where optimizing the route cost takes precedence. It works well when you have sufficient computational resources to explore different insertion points efficiently.

3. **nearest_neighbor_54a9()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for instances where node demands vary significantly, and vehicles have limited remaining capacity. It's effective in dense node environments where quick decision-making is needed to avoid overloading vehicles.
   - **Best Quantified By**: High node density and varying demands. It's also applicable when the problem size is small to moderate, allowing the heuristic to perform additional optimization like 2-opt effectively.

4. **node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the initial solution has uneven load distribution across routes, and there's a need to balance the load or reduce travel distance.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Imbalanced vehicle loads and when there's room to reallocate nodes between routes without violating capacity constraints. It is most effective in later stages of optimization or when initial solutions have significant imbalances.

5. **three_opt_e8d7()**:
   - **Scenario**: This is a powerful local search heuristic for improving existing routes. It's applicable when you have a feasible solution and need to explore complex neighborhood structures to optimize the route further.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Suitable for relatively small to moderate problem sizes, where the computational cost of evaluating multiple route changes is justified by the potential improvement in solution quality.

6. **two_opt_0554()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for simplifying and optimizing routes by removing crossing paths. It's a classic heuristic for improving route compactness.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Problems where routes have unnecessary overlaps or where initial solutions can be easily improved by route simplifications. It's effective in both small and large problem instances, given its relatively low computational cost compared to 3-opt.

These heuristics are often used iteratively or in combination to tackle different aspects of the CVRP, starting with initial solution construction and followed by iterative refinement to enhance solution quality.
