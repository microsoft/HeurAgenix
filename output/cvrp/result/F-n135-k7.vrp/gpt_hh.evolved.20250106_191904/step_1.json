                "text": "When working with heuristic algorithms for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), it's essential to understand the specific scenarios where each heuristic might perform optimally. Here's an analysis of each algorithm and the situations where they are most applicable:\n\n1. **farthest_insertion_6308()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when you have a diverse set of nodes with varying distances from the depot. It is particularly effective in instances where there are clusters of nodes far from the starting point.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: High variance in node distances and when the problem size (number of nodes) is moderate to large. It can help in quickly generating a feasible initial solution by focusing on the outermost nodes and gradually building inwards.\n\n2. **min_cost_insertion_3b2b()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This approach is suitable for scenarios where cost efficiency is paramount, and the primary objective is to minimize the travel cost rather than just finding a feasible route.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Situations where the distance matrix has varying costs and where optimizing the route cost takes precedence. It works well when you have sufficient computational resources to explore different insertion points efficiently.\n\n3. **nearest_neighbor_54a9()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best suited for instances where node demands vary significantly, and vehicles have limited remaining capacity. It's effective in dense node environments where quick decision-making is needed to avoid overloading vehicles.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: High node density and varying demands. It's also applicable when the problem size is small to moderate, allowing the heuristic to perform additional optimization like 2-opt effectively.\n\n4. **node_shift_between_routes_7b8a()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the initial solution has uneven load distribution across routes, and there's a need to balance the load or reduce travel distance.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Imbalanced vehicle loads and when there's room to reallocate nodes between routes without violating capacity constraints. It is most effective in later stages of optimization or when initial solutions have significant imbalances.\n\n5. **three_opt_e8d7()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This is a powerful local search heuristic for improving existing routes. It's applicable when you have a feasible solution and need to explore complex neighborhood structures to optimize the route further.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Suitable for relatively small to moderate problem sizes, where the computational cost of evaluating multiple route changes is justified by the potential improvement in solution quality.\n\n6. **two_opt_0554()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful for simplifying and optimizing routes by removing crossing paths. It's a classic heuristic for improving route compactness.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Problems where routes have unnecessary overlaps or where initial solutions can be easily improved by route simplifications. It's effective in both small and large problem instances, given its relatively low computational cost compared to 3-opt.\n\nThese heuristics are often used iteratively or in combination to tackle different aspects of the CVRP, starting with initial solution construction and followed by iterative refinement to enhance solution quality."

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution.
