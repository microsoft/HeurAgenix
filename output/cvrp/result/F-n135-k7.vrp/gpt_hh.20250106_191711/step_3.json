The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance.

This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

                "text": "Given the current state of the solution and the performance of the previously applied heuristics, here's a strategic approach for the next steps:\n\n1. **Assessment of Farthest Insertion Performance**: The Farthest Insertion heuristic added 15 nodes and significantly increased the total current cost by 560.0. This suggests that while nodes were efficiently added, the cost-effectiveness of the routes may not have been optimized.\n\n2. **Remaining Challenges**: There are still 109 unvisited nodes with a total remaining demand of 10,896. The average remaining vehicle capacity is 1,678.0, indicating that there is room for further optimization, particularly in balancing the loads across vehicles.\n\n3. **Next Heuristic Choice**: Given the high number of unvisited nodes and the need to better balance the load and optimize the routes, the **Node Shift Between Routes** heuristic could be a beneficial next step. This heuristic could help in redistributing nodes across routes to improve load balance and potentially reduce the total cost.\n\n4. **Suggested Steps**: Begin with a modest number of steps to observe initial improvements and evaluate whether further application of the heuristic is warranted.\n\nBased on this analysis, the recommendation is as follows:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: node_shift_between_routes_7b8a\nrunning steps: 10\nexplanation: The Node Shift Between Routes heuristic will attempt to optimize the distribution of nodes across existing routes, focusing on improving load balance and potentially reducing the overall cost. This is particularly relevant given the current high variance in vehicle loads and the substantial number of remaining unvisited nodes. Starting with 10 steps allows us to gauge its initial impact and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n***"
