I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, which inherently involves exploring a large number of possible combinations of routes and assignments of deliveries to vehicles. Heuristic methods are widely used to solve such problems because they provide practical, near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame, especially when the problem size is large or when exact methods become computationally infeasible. Your framework using operators to modify solutions is a common approach in heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to explore the solution space.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is applicable involves understanding the nature of the problem instance and the characteristics of the heuristic. Below is a brief analysis of potential scenarios for each algorithm:

1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic**: 
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for problems where the nodes are spread out and the farthest nodes are critical to be incorporated early to prevent inefficient routes later.
   - **Quantification**: Best for datasets with varied distances between nodes, emphasizing strategic placement of far nodes.

2. **Greedy Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Ideal for problems where quick, feasible solutions are needed without much computational effort.
   - **Quantification**: Works well when node distributions are dense, and the closest nodes tend to be optimal choices.

3. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when minimizing incremental cost is a priority, and there is flexibility in route adjustments.
   - **Quantification**: Optimal for instances where cost and distance metrics are clear and direct insertion impacts are easily measurable.

4. **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful in scenarios with a high density of nodes or when the node distribution is relatively uniform.
   - **Quantification**: Best quantified in problems where routes naturally form around nearest neighbors and capacity constraints are less variable.

5. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where balancing load across routes is crucial, and route adjustments can significantly optimize the solution.
   - **Quantification**: Best when node demands vary and the ability to shift nodes can lead to better load distribution.

6. **Petal Algorithm**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Useful when routes can naturally form around a central depot, and multiple feasible routes (petals) can be created.
   - **Quantification**: Best for problems where route loops are natural and the depot acts as a central hub.

7. **Random Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Applicable in scenarios where exploration of diverse solutions is important, and non-deterministic approaches can lead to new insights.
   - **Quantification**: Best for initial solutions or when other algorithms fail to escape local optima.

8. **Saving Algorithm**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective when there are opportunities to merge routes to save distance or costs, especially in dense networks.
   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where cost savings from merging are significant and can be easily calculated.

9. **3-Opt Heuristic**:
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Suitable for fine-tuning routes where small adjustments can lead to significant improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Best for problems where local adjustments can significantly improve the total route cost.

10. **2-Opt Heuristic**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Similar to 3-opt but generally faster, suitable for moderate improvements in already good solutions.
    - **Quantification**: Best when there are many possible route overlaps or swaps that can be adjusted.

11. **Variable Neighborhood Search**:
    - **Applicable Scenarios**: Effective in complex scenarios where multiple local optima exist, and systematic neighborhood changes can escape local traps.
    - **Quantification**: Best for large, complex problems where diverse neighborhood exploration leads to better global solutions.

These analyses help in selecting the appropriate heuristic based on the specific characteristics and requirements of the problem at hand.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Given the current state of the problem and the available heuristics, we should consider an initial heuristic that can provide a solid starting point for constructing the solution. The Greedy heuristic is often a good choice for such initial solutions due to its simplicity and effectiveness in quickly constructing a feasible solution. Here's a suggestion on how to proceed:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_f4c4
running steps: 10
explanation: The Greedy heuristic will quickly construct initial routes by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route. This approach is effective given the high number of unvisited nodes and the current state where no nodes have been allocated to any routes. Running 10 steps will allow us to establish a preliminary solution upon which more refined heuristics can be applied.
