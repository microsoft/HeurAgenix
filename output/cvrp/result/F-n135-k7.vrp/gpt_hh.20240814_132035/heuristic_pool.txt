I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id

        new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id] = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]
        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Let's analyze the scenarios where each of these heuristic algorithms for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is most applicable. I'll also discuss how these scenarios can be quantified to help determine the best algorithm to use.

### 1. **2-opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when you have an initial solution that you want to improve by removing local loops and reducing the total route length.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution quality: High initial total distance.
     - Number of vehicles and nodes: Moderate to high, as 2-opt can be computationally expensive for very large instances.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**
   - **Scenario**: Best for escaping local optima and exploring diverse solutions by systematically changing the neighborhood structure.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Current solution quality: Stuck in local optima.
     - Problem size: Can handle larger instances due to its exploratory nature.
     - Computational resources: Requires moderate to high computational resources.

### 3. **3-opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**
   - **Scenario**: Similar to 2-opt but aims to remove more complex local loops, potentially leading to better solutions.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution quality: High initial total distance with more complex local loops.
     - Problem size: Suitable for moderate to large instances, but more computationally intensive than 2-opt.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**
   - **Scenario**: Useful for quickly generating an initial feasible solution by iteratively visiting the nearest unvisited node.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution need: Quick, feasible solution.
     - Problem size: Suitable for small to moderate instances due to its greedy nature.
     - Distance matrix characteristics: Works well when the distance matrix is highly non-uniform.

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)**
   - **Scenario**: Similar to Nearest Neighbor but focuses on adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution need: Quick, feasible solution.
     - Problem size: Small to moderate instances.
     - Distance matrix characteristics: Effective when the distance matrix has a clear gradient or pattern.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**
   - **Scenario**: Best for merging routes by considering savings in travel distance, starting with individual routes and combining them.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution quality: Suitable when routes can be effectively merged.
     - Problem size: Moderate to large instances.
     - Merge threshold: Determines how aggressively routes are combined.

### 7. **Random Heuristic (`random_bfdc`)**
   - **Scenario**: Useful for generating diverse initial solutions or when you want to explore different parts of the solution space randomly.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Solution diversity need: High.
     - Problem size: Small to moderate instances.
     - Capacity constraints: Ensures random assignments respect capacity.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**
   - **Scenario**: Constructs routes (petals) around the depot, useful for creating individual routes that can be combined later.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution structure: Routes forming loops around the depot.
     - Problem size: Moderate to large instances.
     - Depot-centric: Effective when the depot is centrally located.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**
   - **Scenario**: Selects the farthest unvisited node and inserts it into a route to minimize the increase in total distance.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Node distribution: Works well when nodes are spread out.
     - Problem size: Moderate to large instances.
     - Distance matrix characteristics: Effective when the distance matrix has distant outliers.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**
   - **Scenario**: Attempts to move a node from one route to another, aiming to balance loads or reduce distance.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Load balancing need: High.
     - Current solution quality: High total distance or imbalanced loads.
     - Problem size: Suitable for moderate instances.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**
   - **Scenario**: Inserts nodes into routes at the minimum cost, useful for creating cost-effective solutions.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Cost efficiency need: High.
     - Problem size: Moderate to large instances.
     - Distance matrix characteristics: Effective for highly variable distances.

### Summary
To determine the most suitable algorithm, consider the following factors:
- **Initial Solution Quality**: Whether you need a quick initial solution or want to improve an existing one.
- **Problem Size**: The number of nodes and vehicles.
- **Computational Resources**: The available computational power and time constraints.
- **Distance Matrix Characteristics**: The distribution and variability of distances between nodes.
- **Capacity Constraints**: How strictly the vehicle capacities need to be respected.

By quantifying these factors, you can choose the most appropriate heuristic algorithm for your specific CVRP instance. Feel free to ask more questions or provide specific scenarios for further analysis!
