Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is best suited and the metrics or problem features that quantify these scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Works well for problems where route diversification is critical to avoid clustering of nodes early in the solution.  \n   - Suitable for instances with sparse node distribution, where it is necessary to explore \"outlier\" nodes early to reduce the overall cost.  \n   - Performs better when the problem size is moderate (e.g., not too small or too large).  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: Higher standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating sparse or uneven spatial distribution of nodes).  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013200 nodes).  \n   - **Capacity Utilization**: Effective when vehicle capacity is relatively tight, as it considers capacity utilization.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Ideal for structured problems where insertion costs dominate the solution quality.  \n   - Best for small to medium-sized problems where computational efficiency is critical.  \n   - Performs well when the distance matrix is uniform or nodes are evenly distributed.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30\u2013150 nodes).  \n   - **Distance Matrix Uniformity**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating uniform node distribution).  \n   - **Time Constraints**: Limited computational budget or time restrictions.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for problems where quick and simple solutions are needed.  \n   - Effective for problems with higher node density, as it performs well when nodes are clustered.  \n   - Useful in scenarios with limited computational resources or as an initial solution generator for more advanced algorithms.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating dense clusters of nodes).  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Small to medium-scale problems (e.g., 20\u2013100 nodes).  \n   - **Computation Time**: Very low computational budget.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for problems where merging routes can yield significant savings.  \n   - Applicable when the vehicle capacity is not overly restrictive, allowing for effective route merging.  \n   - Performs well for medium to large-scale problems where initial savings-based route construction is computationally efficient.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Merge Potential**: Higher proportion of nodes with mutual proximity, quantified by clustering tendency in the distance matrix.  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).  \n   - **Vehicle Capacity**: Moderate to high capacity relative to node demand.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **3-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for refining solutions to achieve near-optimal results.  \n   - Best applied after an initial solution is generated by other heuristics.  \n   - Works well for dense or moderately dense problems where route compactness is critical.  \n   - Computationally intensive, so it is better suited for small to medium-sized problems.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30\u2013150 nodes).  \n   - **Route Compactness**: Problems where route overlap or inefficiencies are high (quantified by total route cost before refinement).  \n   - **Time Constraints**: More computationally intensive, so applicable when sufficient computational budget exists.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **2-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Similar to 3-opt but computationally less intensive, making it more suitable for larger problems or tighter time constraints.  \n   - Best used for improving compactness and reducing total route cost in a solution.  \n   - Effective as a standalone refinement method or in combination with simpler heuristics like nearest neighbor.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).  \n   - **Route Compactness**: Problems with moderate inefficiencies in route cost.  \n   - **Time Constraints**: Lower computational budget compared to 3-opt.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Scenarios and Metrics\n\n| **Heuristic**              | **Best Problem Size (Nodes)** | **Key Metrics**                                                                                      | **Best Use Case**                             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Farthest Insertion          | 50\u2013200                       | High distance matrix variance (sparse distribution), medium-scale size, tight capacity utilization    | Diversification, handling outliers            |\n| Min-Cost Insertion          | 30\u2013150                       | Uniform node distribution, low computational budget                                                  | Efficient route construction                  |\n| Nearest Neighbor            | 20\u2013100                       | Dense clusters of nodes, very low computational budget                                               | Quick initial solution generation             |\n| Saving Algorithm            | 50\u2013300                       | High clustering tendency, moderate to high vehicle capacity                                          | Effective route merging for large problems    |\n| 3-Opt                       | 30\u2013150                       | High initial route cost, sufficient computational budget                                             | Refinement for dense/moderately dense problems|\n| 2-Opt                       | 50\u2013300                       | Moderate inefficiencies in routes, lower computational budget                                        | Faster refinement for larger problems         |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n1. **Combining Heuristics**:  \n   - For larger problems, an initial solution can be generated using `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `saving_algorithm_710e`, followed by refinement using `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`.  \n   - For smaller problems, `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` can directly generate high-quality solutions.  \n\n2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  \n   - The `merge_threshold` in `saving_algorithm_710e` should be tuned based on problem-specific features, such as clustering tendency or vehicle capacity constraints.  \n\nBy aligning the heuristics to the problem's characteristics, their performance can be significantly enhanced."
