                "text": "To analyze scenarios where each algorithm is most applicable, we consider key factors such as problem size, structure, constraints, and computational requirements. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is best suited and the metrics or problem features that quantify these scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Works well for problems where route diversification is critical to avoid clustering of nodes early in the solution.  \n   - Suitable for instances with sparse node distribution, where it is necessary to explore \"outlier\" nodes early to reduce the overall cost.  \n   - Performs better when the problem size is moderate (e.g., not too small or too large).  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: Higher standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating sparse or uneven spatial distribution of nodes).  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013200 nodes).  \n   - **Capacity Utilization**: Effective when vehicle capacity is relatively tight, as it considers capacity utilization.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Ideal for structured problems where insertion costs dominate the solution quality.  \n   - Best for small to medium-sized problems where computational efficiency is critical.  \n   - Performs well when the distance matrix is uniform or nodes are evenly distributed.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30\u2013150 nodes).  \n   - **Distance Matrix Uniformity**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating uniform node distribution).  \n   - **Time Constraints**: Limited computational budget or time restrictions.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for problems where quick and simple solutions are needed.  \n   - Effective for problems with higher node density, as it performs well when nodes are clustered.  \n   - Useful in scenarios with limited computational resources or as an initial solution generator for more advanced algorithms.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Distribution**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating dense clusters of nodes).  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Small to medium-scale problems (e.g., 20\u2013100 nodes).  \n   - **Computation Time**: Very low computational budget.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Best for problems where merging routes can yield significant savings.  \n   - Applicable when the vehicle capacity is not overly restrictive, allowing for effective route merging.  \n   - Performs well for medium to large-scale problems where initial savings-based route construction is computationally efficient.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Merge Potential**: Higher proportion of nodes with mutual proximity, quantified by clustering tendency in the distance matrix.  \n   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).  \n   - **Vehicle Capacity**: Moderate to high capacity relative to node demand.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **3-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Suitable for refining solutions to achieve near-optimal results.  \n   - Best applied after an initial solution is generated by other heuristics.  \n   - Works well for dense or moderately dense problems where route compactness is critical.  \n   - Computationally intensive, so it is better suited for small to medium-sized problems.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30\u2013150 nodes).  \n   - **Route Compactness**: Problems where route overlap or inefficiencies are high (quantified by total route cost before refinement).  \n   - **Time Constraints**: More computationally intensive, so applicable when sufficient computational budget exists.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **2-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**\n   **Scenario**:  \n   - Similar to 3-opt but computationally less intensive, making it more suitable for larger problems or tighter time constraints.  \n   - Best used for improving compactness and reducing total route cost in a solution.  \n   - Effective as a standalone refinement method or in combination with simpler heuristics like nearest neighbor.  \n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  \n   - **Node Count**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50\u2013300 nodes).  \n   - **Route Compactness**: Problems with moderate inefficiencies in route cost.  \n   - **Time Constraints**: Lower computational budget compared to 3-opt.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Scenarios and Metrics\n\n| **Heuristic**              | **Best Problem Size (Nodes)** | **Key Metrics**                                                                                      | **Best Use Case**                             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Farthest Insertion          | 50\u2013200                       | High distance matrix variance (sparse distribution), medium-scale size, tight capacity utilization    | Diversification, handling outliers            |\n| Min-Cost Insertion          | 30\u2013150                       | Uniform node distribution, low computational budget                                                  | Efficient route construction                  |\n| Nearest Neighbor            | 20\u2013100                       | Dense clusters of nodes, very low computational budget                                               | Quick initial solution generation             |\n| Saving Algorithm            | 50\u2013300                       | High clustering tendency, moderate to high vehicle capacity                                          | Effective route merging for large problems    |\n| 3-Opt                       | 30\u2013150                       | High initial route cost, sufficient computational budget                                             | Refinement for dense/moderately dense problems|\n| 2-Opt                       | 50\u2013300                       | Moderate inefficiencies in routes, lower computational budget                                        | Faster refinement for larger problems         |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n1. **Combining Heuristics**:  \n   - For larger problems, an initial solution can be generated using `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `saving_algorithm_710e`, followed by refinement using `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`.  \n   - For smaller problems, `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` can directly generate high-quality solutions.  \n\n2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  \n   - The `merge_threshold` in `saving_algorithm_710e` should be tuned based on problem-specific features, such as clustering tendency or vehicle capacity constraints.  \n\nBy aligning the heuristics to the problem's characteristics, their performance can be significantly enhanced."

The `saving_algorithm_710e` is well-suited for initial solution construction in medium-to-large problems, especially when vehicle capacity utilization is high (0.945). This heuristic will efficiently merge routes while respecting capacity constraints, creating a good starting solution for further refinement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: 0). However, given the high clustering tendency (indicated by the average distance and variance), high vehicle capacity utilization (0.945), and large number of unvisited nodes (134), this heuristic remains a strong candidate for constructing an initial solution. Increasing the running steps to 20 will provide it with more iterations to generate meaningful progress while still respecting its suitability for this stage of the problem. If progress remains stagnant after this, we can consider switching to another heuristic, such as `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b`, for further construction.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `saving_algorithm_710e` has not made any progress in the last two rounds despite running for 30 steps in total, as indicated by no change in the number of visited nodes, current cost, or fulfilled demands. Given the high number of unvisited nodes (134) and the relatively high average unvisited node demand (109.10), a more localized and demand-aware heuristic is needed to start building routes effectively. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` is a suitable choice as it prioritizes nodes with higher demands that fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, making it effective for initial solution construction in this scenario. Running it for 15 steps provides a balanced approach to gauge its effectiveness while avoiding excessive computation.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 55.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 1597\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has demonstrated progress in the previous round, resulting in 15 additional visited nodes, a cost increase of 55.0, and 1597 fulfilled demands. Given the current state, with 119 unvisited nodes and high average unvisited node demand (109.44), this heuristic remains effective for constructing routes while balancing capacity constraints. Running it for another 15 steps will allow further progress, especially as it is demand-aware and localized, without overcommitting computational resources.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 33.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 689\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has shown consistent progress in the last two rounds, achieving substantial increases in the number of visited nodes (15 nodes per round) and fulfilling significant demands (1597 and 689 respectively). With 104 unvisited nodes remaining and a high average unvisited node demand (118.60), this heuristic remains suitable for constructing the solution further. Running it for another 15 steps allows for incremental progress while leveraging its demand-aware and localized nature. If progress diminishes, we can consider switching to refinement heuristics like `2_opt_0554` for route improvement.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 60.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 1333\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently made progress in the last three rounds, with 15 additional nodes visited per round and significant demand fulfillment (1597, 689, and 1333 respectively). With 89 unvisited nodes remaining and an average unvisited node demand of 123.61, this heuristic remains effective for constructing the solution further. Running it for another 15 steps ensures continuity in progress while leveraging its demand-aware and localized nature. If the improvement diminishes after this round, we can evaluate switching to refinement heuristics like `2_opt_0554`.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 30.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 607\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
