I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position

        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding the best combination of routes and assignments of customers to vehicles while satisfying constraints such as vehicle capacity. This problem can be effectively tackled using heuristics and metaheuristics, and your provided framework, including `Solution`, `Operator`, and the heuristic function signature, is well-suited for addressing such problems.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To analyze scenarios where each algorithm is most applicable, we consider key factors such as problem size, structure, constraints, and computational requirements. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is best suited and the metrics or problem features that quantify these scenarios:

---

### 1. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic (`farthest_insertion_6308`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Works well for problems where route diversification is critical to avoid clustering of nodes early in the solution.  
   - Suitable for instances with sparse node distribution, where it is necessary to explore "outlier" nodes early to reduce the overall cost.  
   - Performs better when the problem size is moderate (e.g., not too small or too large).  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Node Distribution**: Higher standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating sparse or uneven spatial distribution of nodes).  
   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium-scale problems (e.g., 50–200 nodes).  
   - **Capacity Utilization**: Effective when vehicle capacity is relatively tight, as it considers capacity utilization.  

---

### 2. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic (`min_cost_insertion_3b2b`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Ideal for structured problems where insertion costs dominate the solution quality.  
   - Best for small to medium-sized problems where computational efficiency is critical.  
   - Performs well when the distance matrix is uniform or nodes are evenly distributed.  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30–150 nodes).  
   - **Distance Matrix Uniformity**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating uniform node distribution).  
   - **Time Constraints**: Limited computational budget or time restrictions.  

---

### 3. **Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (`nearest_neighbor_54a9`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Best for problems where quick and simple solutions are needed.  
   - Effective for problems with higher node density, as it performs well when nodes are clustered.  
   - Useful in scenarios with limited computational resources or as an initial solution generator for more advanced algorithms.  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Node Distribution**: Low standard deviation in the distance matrix (indicating dense clusters of nodes).  
   - **Number of Nodes**: Small to medium-scale problems (e.g., 20–100 nodes).  
   - **Computation Time**: Very low computational budget.  

---

### 4. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Best for problems where merging routes can yield significant savings.  
   - Applicable when the vehicle capacity is not overly restrictive, allowing for effective route merging.  
   - Performs well for medium to large-scale problems where initial savings-based route construction is computationally efficient.  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Merge Potential**: Higher proportion of nodes with mutual proximity, quantified by clustering tendency in the distance matrix.  
   - **Number of Nodes**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50–300 nodes).  
   - **Vehicle Capacity**: Moderate to high capacity relative to node demand.  

---

### 5. **3-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d7`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Suitable for refining solutions to achieve near-optimal results.  
   - Best applied after an initial solution is generated by other heuristics.  
   - Works well for dense or moderately dense problems where route compactness is critical.  
   - Computationally intensive, so it is better suited for small to medium-sized problems.  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Node Count**: Small to medium-sized problems (e.g., 30–150 nodes).  
   - **Route Compactness**: Problems where route overlap or inefficiencies are high (quantified by total route cost before refinement).  
   - **Time Constraints**: More computationally intensive, so applicable when sufficient computational budget exists.  

---

### 6. **2-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**
   **Scenario**:  
   - Similar to 3-opt but computationally less intensive, making it more suitable for larger problems or tighter time constraints.  
   - Best used for improving compactness and reducing total route cost in a solution.  
   - Effective as a standalone refinement method or in combination with simpler heuristics like nearest neighbor.  

   **Quantifiable Metrics**:  
   - **Node Count**: Medium to large-scale problems (e.g., 50–300 nodes).  
   - **Route Compactness**: Problems with moderate inefficiencies in route cost.  
   - **Time Constraints**: Lower computational budget compared to 3-opt.

---

### Additional Notes:
1. **Combining Heuristics**:  
   - For larger problems, an initial solution can be generated using `nearest_neighbor_54a9` or `saving_algorithm_710e`, followed by refinement using `two_opt_0554` or `three_opt_e8d7`.  
   - For smaller problems, `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` can directly generate high-quality solutions.  

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
   - The `merge_threshold` in `saving_algorithm_710e` should be tuned based on problem-specific features, such as clustering tendency or vehicle capacity constraints.  

By aligning the heuristics to the problem's characteristics, their performance can be significantly enhanced.
