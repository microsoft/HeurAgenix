This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order.

Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

The current state after applying the Nearest Neighbor heuristic shows that one vehicle has visited five nodes, leaving 129 nodes unvisited.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Current Heuristic**: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic has provided a quick initial solution but has only partially filled one vehicle's route.\n- **Current State**: \n  - **Visited Nodes**: 6\n  - **Unvisited Nodes**: 129\n  - **Fulfilled Demands**: 465\n  - **Remaining Demands**: 14155\n  - **Current Cost**: 28.0\n  - **Vehicle Utilization**: Only one vehicle has been utilized so far.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Current Sufficiency**: The data provided seems sufficient for making a decision on the next heuristic to apply.\n- **Refinement Needed**: The current solution needs further refinement and expansion, as many nodes remain unvisited and most vehicles are unused.\n- **Performance of Nearest Neighbor**: It has provided a quick start, but it may not be the best option for continued use as it may not efficiently handle the remaining nodes.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the state of the current solution, it would be beneficial to apply a heuristic that can both build upon the existing routes and explore new routes for unused vehicles. The Greedy heuristic is a good candidate as it will continue to construct routes by adding the closest unvisited nodes, which can help in further developing the solution efficiently.\n\n### Recommendation:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: greedy_f4c4\nrunning steps: 10\nexplanation: The Greedy heuristic will continue constructing the solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route. This will help in efficiently building upon the current partial solution and expanding the routes for other vehicles.\n***\n\nBy running the Greedy heuristic for 10 steps, we can expect to see significant progress in constructing the solution. After these steps, we can review the performance and decide on the next course of action."
