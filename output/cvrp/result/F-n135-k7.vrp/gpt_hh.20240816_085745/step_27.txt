I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1

            self.position2 = position2
        else:

            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:

    - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is cvrp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Absolutely, let's go through each heuristic algorithm and analyze the scenarios where they are most applicable:

### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**
- **Scenario**: When the current solution needs refinement through local optimization.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - A relatively good initial solution is available.
  - Moderate to high number of nodes.
  - Focus on reducing local route inefficiencies.

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**
- **Scenario**: When the solution is stuck in a local minimum and needs to explore different neighborhoods.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - High number of nodes and complex problem instances.
  - Need for a robust exploration mechanism.
  - Flexibility in applying different operators.

### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic (`three_opt_e8d`)**
- **Scenario**: When a more intensive local search is needed compared to Two-Opt.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - High number of nodes.
  - The need for thorough local optimization.
  - Cases where Two-Opt has plateaued in improvement.

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor (`nearest_neighbor_99ba`)**
- **Scenario**: When a quick and simple initial solution is needed.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - Moderate to large number of nodes.
  - Cases where an initial feasible solution is required rapidly.
  - Situations with less emphasis on optimality but more on feasibility.

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic (`greedy_f4c4`)**
- **Scenario**: When constructing an initial solution with a focus on immediate distance minimization.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - Moderate number of nodes.
  - Instances where a simple and intuitive approach is acceptable.
  - Initial solution construction with a focus on minimizing distance.

### 6. **Saving Algorithm (`saving_algorithm_710e`)**
- **Scenario**: When merging routes to minimize the total distance.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - High number of nodes.
  - Instances where combining routes can lead to significant savings.
  - Scenarios with high savings potential between route merges.

### 7. **Random Heuristic (`random_bfdc`)**
- **Scenario**: When a diverse set of initial solutions is needed.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - Any number of nodes.
  - Requirement for stochastic solution generation.
  - Cases where randomness can help escape local minima.

### 8. **Petal Algorithm (`petal_algorithm_b384`)**
- **Scenario**: When constructing routes around a central depot.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - Moderate to high number of nodes.
  - Instances where routes naturally form loops around the depot.
  - Scenarios with a central depot and surrounding customer nodes.

### 9. **Farthest Insertion (`farthest_insertion_ce2b`)**
- **Scenario**: When focusing on inserting nodes that are farthest first to minimize overall distance.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - High number of nodes.
  - Instances where the depot is centrally located.
  - Situations where initial insertion of distant nodes can lead to better overall routes.

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes (`node_shift_between_routes_7b8a`)**
- **Scenario**: When rebalancing loads or improving route efficiency by shifting nodes between routes.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - Moderate to high number of nodes.
  - Instances with noticeable imbalance between vehicle routes.
  - Situations requiring fine-tuning of existing routes.

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion (`min_cost_insertion_7bfa`)**
- **Scenario**: When inserting nodes in a way that minimizes additional cost.
- **Best Quantified By**:
  - High number of nodes.
  - Instances where cost efficiency is crucial.
  - Situations where careful node insertion can lead to significant cost savings.

Each algorithm has its unique strengths and is best suited for different scenarios. By carefully selecting the appropriate heuristic based on the problem characteristics and current solution state, you can effectively tackle the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: variable_neighborhood_search_614b. How does variable_neighborhood_search_614b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

assistant
Given the current state and the historical progress, let's analyze the situation:

### Current State
- **Total Nodes**: 135
- **Visited Nodes**: 135 (all nodes visited)
- **Unvisited Nodes**: 0
- **Fulfilled Demands**: 14620
- **Remaining Demands**: 0
- **Total Current Cost**: 1573.0
- **Vehicle Information**: All vehicles have routes, and the loads are well-distributed.

### Recent Heuristic Performance
- **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)**: Has shown effectiveness in reducing costs but seems to have plateaued.
- **Variable Neighborhood Search (`variable_neighborhood_search_614b`)**: Has been used recently but with no significant improvements.

### Considerations
- **Data Sufficiency**: We have a comprehensive set of data.
- **Current Solution State**: All nodes are visited, and demands are fulfilled. The focus should now be on refining and potentially reducing the overall cost.
- **Heuristic Selection**: Given the plateau in improvements with Two-Opt and VNS, we might consider a heuristic that can further fine-tune the solution or explore new neighborhoods effectively.

### Decision
Based on the data, historical performance, and current state, it seems prudent to continue refining the solution. Since VNS did not yield improvements recently, we might switch back to a heuristic known for fine-tuning.

### Proposed Action
The **Two-Opt Heuristic (`two_opt_0554`)** has shown potential in reducing costs. Given that all nodes are visited and the demands are fulfilled, running it for additional steps might still yield some incremental improvements.

### Action Plan
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: two_opt_0554
running steps: 10
explanation: The Two-Opt heuristic has been effective in the past at reducing the overall cost. Given that the current solution is at a good state with all demands fulfilled, continuing with Two-Opt for 10 more steps will allow for further route optimization and potential cost reduction.
