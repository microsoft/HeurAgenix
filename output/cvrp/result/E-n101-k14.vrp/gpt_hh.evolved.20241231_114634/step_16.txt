I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):

        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):

    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

***is_cop:yes***  

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem (COP). It involves searching for an optimal arrangement of discrete components (routes and assignments of nodes to vehicles) under specific constraints (capacity, distance, etc.). Heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are widely used to solve such problems effectively, especially when exact methods become computationally infeasible for large instances.  

Your framework for the solution, operators, and heuristic function signatures appears to be well-structured and aligned with the needs of heuristic approaches for solving CVRP.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Before this discuss, we have already 16 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_insertion_6308
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: At this stage, all vehicles have empty routes, and no nodes (besides the depot) have been visited. The high distance variance (267.39) and sparse distribution of nodes suggest that the farthest insertion heuristic is a good starting point to explore distant nodes while ensuring capacity constraints are met. This will establish a foundation of routes for further refinement by subsequent heuristics.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 93.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 158
---Round 1---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a large number of unvisited nodes (90) and high demand variance (79.22). `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` is well-suited for this stage to efficiently expand routes by inserting unvisited nodes into existing routes with minimal cost. Running for 15 steps balances exploration with efficiency to further develop the solution.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 105.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 153
---Round 2---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current state shows a large number of unvisited nodes (75), with an average unvisited node demand of 15.29 and a total remaining demand of 1147. The high demand variance (79.22) and relatively low vehicle utilization (0.929) suggest that there is room to assign nodes to vehicles more efficiently. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is a good choice at this stage because it prioritizes nearby nodes while considering demand and capacity constraints. This will help improve route compactness and reduce the number of unvisited nodes further, balancing exploration and exploitation. Running for 15 steps provides a reasonable progression without overcommitting to the heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 163.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 204
---Round 3---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has made significant progress, but there are still 60 unvisited nodes with an average unvisited node demand of 15.72 and a total remaining demand of 943. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the last round by reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. Given the relatively high demand variance (79.22) and the opportunity to further exploit nearby nodes for efficient vehicle capacity utilization, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical choice. This will allow us to focus on refining the solution further without overcommitting to a single heuristic.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 89.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 142
---Round 4---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in refining the solution by reducing unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. Running it for another 10 steps allows for further incremental improvements, targeting the remaining unvisited nodes while balancing vehicle capacity utilization. This continuation is logical given the problem's current state.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 137.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 117
---Round 5---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current solution has made steady progress, with 40 unvisited nodes remaining and an average unvisited node demand of 17.1. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness in the last three rounds. Given the relatively high demand variance (79.22) and the opportunity to further exploit nearby nodes for better vehicle capacity utilization, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical choice to incrementally refine the solution further. This approach balances exploration and exploitation.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 176.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 152
---Round 6---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in recent rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. There are still 30 unvisited nodes with an average unvisited node demand of 17.73 and a total remaining demand of 532. The high demand variance (79.22) suggests opportunities for further improvement by exploiting nearby nodes while maintaining capacity constraints. Running this heuristic for another 10 steps balances incremental progress with computational efficiency.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The current solution is nearing completion, with only 5 unvisited nodes remaining and a total remaining demand of 130. Given that `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has consistently performed well in reducing unvisited nodes and improving route compactness, it is logical to continue with this heuristic. Running it for another 5 steps balances further refinement with the diminishing returns expected as the problem approaches completion. This allows for efficient exploitation of nearby nodes while adhering to capacity constraints.

Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The current solution is very close to completion, with all nodes visited and total demand served. However, the total cost of the solution (1374.0) and the standard deviation of route lengths (2.356) suggest there is still room for minor refinements in route compactness and cost optimization. Since `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has consistently performed well in improving route compactness and balancing vehicle capacity utilization, running it for another 5 steps is a logical choice. This allows for further incremental improvements while considering the diminishing returns expected at this stage.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: two_opt_0554. How does two_opt_0554 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
