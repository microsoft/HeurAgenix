The high distance variance (267.39) and sparse distribution of nodes suggest that the farthest insertion heuristic is a good starting point to explore distant nodes while ensuring capacity constraints are met. This will establish a foundation of routes for further refinement by subsequent heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 93.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 158\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current solution has a large number of unvisited nodes (90) and high demand variance (79.22). `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` is well-suited for this stage to efficiently expand routes by inserting unvisited nodes into existing routes with minimal cost. Running for 15 steps balances exploration with efficiency to further develop the solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 105.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 153\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state shows a large number of unvisited nodes (75), with an average unvisited node demand of 15.29 and a total remaining demand of 1147. The high demand variance (79.22) and relatively low vehicle utilization (0.929) suggest that there is room to assign nodes to vehicles more efficiently. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic is a good choice at this stage because it prioritizes nearby nodes while considering demand and capacity constraints. This will help improve route compactness and reduce the number of unvisited nodes further, balancing exploration and exploitation. Running for 15 steps provides a reasonable progression without overcommitting to the heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 163.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 204\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has made significant progress, but there are still 60 unvisited nodes with an average unvisited node demand of 15.72 and a total remaining demand of 943. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has performed well in the last round by reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. Given the relatively high demand variance (79.22) and the opportunity to further exploit nearby nodes for efficient vehicle capacity utilization, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical choice. This will allow us to focus on refining the solution further without overcommitting to a single heuristic.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 89.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 142\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in refining the solution by reducing unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. Running it for another 10 steps allows for further incremental improvements, targeting the remaining unvisited nodes while balancing vehicle capacity utilization. This continuation is logical given the problem's current state.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 137.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 117\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current solution has made steady progress, with 40 unvisited nodes remaining and an average unvisited node demand of 17.1. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has been effective in reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness in the last three rounds. Given the relatively high demand variance (79.22) and the opportunity to further exploit nearby nodes for better vehicle capacity utilization, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical choice to incrementally refine the solution further. This approach balances exploration and exploitation.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 176.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 152\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in recent rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. There are still 30 unvisited nodes with an average unvisited node demand of 17.73 and a total remaining demand of 532. The high demand variance (79.22) suggests opportunities for further improvement by exploiting nearby nodes while maintaining capacity constraints. Running this heuristic for another 10 steps balances incremental progress with computational efficiency.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 112.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 167\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently yielded positive results in recent rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. With 20 unvisited nodes remaining, an average unvisited node demand of 18.25, and a total remaining demand of 365, there is still room to refine the solution further. The high demand variance (79.22) indicates that prioritizing nearby nodes with higher demands can continue to improve vehicle capacity utilization. Running the heuristic for another 10 steps balances incremental refinement with computational efficiency.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 193.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 140\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has consistently performed well in recent rounds, effectively reducing the number of unvisited nodes and improving route compactness. With only 10 unvisited nodes remaining, an average unvisited node demand of 22.5, and a total remaining demand of 225, there is still room to exploit nearby nodes while maintaining capacity constraints. Running the heuristic for 5 steps balances further incremental refinement with the diminishing returns expected as the problem nears completion.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 72.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 95\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution is nearing completion, with only 5 unvisited nodes remaining and a total remaining demand of 130. Given that `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has consistently performed well in reducing unvisited nodes and improving route compactness, it is logical to continue with this heuristic. Running it for another 5 steps balances further refinement with the diminishing returns expected as the problem approaches completion. This allows for efficient exploitation of nearby nodes while adhering to capacity constraints.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 5\nDelta of Current Cost: 234.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 130\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution is very close to completion, with all nodes visited and total demand served. However, the total cost of the solution (1374.0) and the standard deviation of route lengths (2.356) suggest there is still room for minor refinements in route compactness and cost optimization. Since `nearest_neighbor_54a9` has consistently performed well in improving route compactness and balancing vehicle capacity utilization, running it for another 5 steps is a logical choice. This allows for further incremental improvements while considering the diminishing returns expected at this stage.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_54a9. How does nearest_neighbor_54a9 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
