I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            if start_index <= end_index:
                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id
        self.source_position = source_position
        self.target_vehicle_id = target_vehicle_id
        self.target_position = target_position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):
        self.source_vehicle_id = source_vehicle_id

        new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id] = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] + new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]
        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.
    - "demands" (numpy.ndarray): The demand of each node.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 77.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 144
---Round 1---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The Greedy algorithm will help us to continue building the solution by adding nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route. Running it for 15 steps will allow us to make substantial progress in constructing the solution while ensuring that we are adding nodes efficiently.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 297.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 219
---Round 2---
Heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) will help us explore different neighborhood structures to improve the current solution. Given the large number of unvisited nodes and empty vehicle routes, VNS is suitable for systematically searching for better solutions while escaping local optima.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 15
Delta of Current Cost: 139.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 196

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: variable_neighborhood_search_614b. How does variable_neighborhood_search_614b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Given the current state of the problem and the progress so far, let's analyze the best next steps:

### Current State Analysis:
- **Visited Nodes**: 41
- **Unvisited Nodes**: 60
- **Fulfilled Demands**: 559
- **Remaining Demands**: 899
- **Total Current Cost**: 513.0

### Vehicle Information:
- **Vehicles with Routes**: 5 out of 14
- **Vehicles without Routes**: 9 out of 14
- **Fully Loaded Vehicles**: 4 out of 5

### Heuristic Performance:
1. **Nearest Neighbor**:
   - **Visited Nodes**: +10
   - **Current Cost Increase**: +77
   - **Fulfilled Demands**: +144

2. **Greedy**:
   - **Visited Nodes**: +15
   - **Current Cost Increase**: +297
   - **Fulfilled Demands**: +219

3. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**:
   - **Visited Nodes**: +15
   - **Current Cost Increase**: +139
   - **Fulfilled Demands**: +196

### Decision Criteria:
- **Current Focus**: We need to balance the exploration of new routes while ensuring the vehicles do not exceed their capacities.
- **Optimization Needed**: Further improvement on the current solution by either exploring new routes or optimizing existing ones.
- **Heuristic Efficacy**: The VNS has shown promise by improving the solution with a modest increase in cost.

### Next Steps Proposal:
Given the need to both construct new routes and optimize existing ones, I suggest continuing with the **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)** for the next steps. This approach will allow us to explore different neighborhood structures, which can help in both creating new routes and optimizing existing ones.

### Suggested Action:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
running steps: 20
explanation: The Variable Neighborhood Search has shown effectiveness in improving the solution by exploring different neighborhood structures. Running it for an additional 20 steps will help in further optimizing the current solution and potentially creating new routes for the remaining unvisited nodes.
