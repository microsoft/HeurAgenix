Farthest Insertion is well-suited for such scenarios as it prioritizes distant nodes, ensuring route compactness while considering capacity utilization.

Starting with 20 steps allows us to construct a robust initial solution while leaving room for further refinement with other heuristics.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 20\nDelta of Current Cost: 179.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 270\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: farthest_insertion_6308. How does farthest_insertion_6308 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

The high vehicle capacity utilization (0.93) and significant remaining vehicle capacity suggest the potential for compact routes while adhering to capacity constraints. Nearest Neighbor is well-suited for this stage as it quickly builds routes by prioritizing proximity and remaining capacity, which aligns with the problem's high node-to-vehicle ratio (7.21). Running 30 steps allows for significant progress in constructing compact routes while keeping computation manageable.  \n***"
