This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.\ndef nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\ndef random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions.

This will provide a good starting point for further improvements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 77.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 144\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic will help in both exploring new routes and optimizing the current routes. It systematically changes the neighborhood structure, which can help in escaping local optima and finding better solutions. Given that we have a good initial solution from the nearest neighbor heuristic, VNS can build upon it and potentially improve the overall solution.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 70.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 125\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The VNS heuristic has shown effectiveness in optimizing the solution by escaping local optima and exploring new routes. Running it for additional steps will help in further refining the solution and potentially improving the overall cost and fulfillment of demands.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 138.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 185\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Greedy heuristic will help construct routes for the remaining vehicles by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node. This will quickly increase the number of visited nodes and fulfilled demands, making efficient use of the remaining vehicles.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 256.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 105\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: saving_algorithm_710e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Saving Algorithm will help in merging routes, optimizing the number of vehicles used, and improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the solution. Given the current state with many unvisited nodes and unused vehicles, this heuristic can provide substantial improvements.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 0\nDelta of Current Cost: 0.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Greedy heuristic will help construct routes for the remaining vehicles by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node. This will quickly increase the number of visited nodes and fulfilled demands, making efficient use of the remaining vehicles.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 337.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 135\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic will help in inserting the remaining unvisited nodes into the current solution by minimizing the additional cost. This approach is expected to improve the overall cost efficiency while ensuring that more nodes are visited and demands are fulfilled.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 10\nDelta of Current Cost: 90.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 161\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The VNS heuristic has shown effectiveness in optimizing the solution by escaping local optima and exploring new routes. Given the current state with many unvisited nodes and available vehicles, VNS can build upon the current solution and potentially improve the overall cost and fulfillment of demands.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 200.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 250\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic will continue optimizing the solution by exploring new neighborhoods and escaping local optima. Given its past performance and the current state, it is expected to further improve the solution by visiting more nodes, fulfilling more demands, and potentially reducing the total cost.\nDelta of Visited Node Num: 15\nDelta of Current Cost: 321.0\nDelta of Fulfilled Demands: 237\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: variable_neighborhood_search_614b. How does variable_neighborhood_search_614b perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.

It's crucial to visit these nodes while minimizing additional costs and respecting vehicle capacity constraints.\n2. **Unused Vehicle:** One vehicle is completely unused, which could be leveraged to visit remaining nodes.\n3. **Previous Heuristic Performance:** VNS has been effective in optimizing the solution, but diminishing returns might be observed with continued use.\n\n### Recommended Heuristic:\nGiven the current state and the remaining tasks, a targeted approach to insert the remaining nodes efficiently is essential. The **Min-Cost Insertion** heuristic is suitable as it focuses on inserting nodes with minimal additional cost, which is ideal for the few remaining unvisited nodes.\n\n### Decision:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: min_cost_insertion_7bfa\nrunning steps: 5\nexplanation: The Min-Cost Insertion heuristic will help in efficiently inserting the remaining unvisited nodes into the current solution by minimizing the additional cost. This will ensure that all nodes are visited while keeping the overall cost low and respecting vehicle capacity constraints.\n***\n\nThis approach will provide a focused and cost-effective way to finalize the solution by addressing the few remaining unvisited nodes. After running the selected heuristic for the specified steps, we can review the performance and determine the next steps if necessary."
