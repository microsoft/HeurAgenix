I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id1
            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_route = new_routes[self.vehicle_id][:]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_routes[self.vehicle_id])

                new_route[start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_route[start_index:end_index + 1])
            else:
                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Move a node from one position in a route to another, possibly in a different route."""
    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, source_position: int, target_vehicle_id: int, target_position: int):

        node = new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id].pop(self.source_position)
        if not new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id]:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].append(node)
        else:
            new_routes[self.target_vehicle_id].insert(self.target_position, node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle.

    def __init__(self, source_vehicle_id: int, target_vehicle_id: int):

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = []
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def farthest_insertion_ce2b(): Farthest Insertion heuristic for the CVRP. This algorithm selects the unvisited node that is farthest from the depot and inserts it into a route that minimizes the increase in total distance, while also considering vehicle capacity constraints. The heuristic continues until no further nodes can be assigned without violating capacity constraints or all nodes are assigned.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def min_cost_insertion_7bfa(): Min-Cost Insertion heuristic for the CVRP.
def nearest_neighbor_99ba(): Nearest Neighbor heuristic for CVRP. This algorithm iterates over each vehicle, starting from the depot. For each vehicle, it finds the nearest unvisited node and appends it to the route, respecting the vehicle's capacity constraints. This process repeats until no further nodes can be visited without exceeding the vehicle's capacity or all nodes have been visited.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.
def random_bfdc(): Random heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic selects an unvisited node at random and appends it to a vehicle's route where it does not violate the capacity constraint. This process is repeated for each vehicle until all nodes have been included in a route.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Each heuristic algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the characteristics of the problem instance. Here’s an analysis of scenarios where each algorithm is applicable and how these scenarios can be quantified:

### 1. **Two-Opt Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Best for fine-tuning an existing solution by removing local loops and reducing the overall route length.
- Works well when the initial solution is close to optimal but can be improved by small local adjustments.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** High (closer to optimal)
- **Problem Size:** Medium to Large (too large may slow down due to combinatorial nature)
- **Route Complexity:** High (many local loops)

### 2. **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**
**Scenario:**
- Effective for escaping local optima by systematically changing the neighborhood structure.
- Best when the solution space is complex and multiple local optima are present.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium to Low
- **Problem Size:** Medium to Large (can handle larger problems better due to neighborhood changes)
- **Route Complexity:** High (many local optima)

### 3. **Three-Opt Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Similar to the 2-opt but allows for more extensive route modifications.
- Useful when 2-opt improvements are exhausted but further optimization is possible.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium to High
- **Problem Size:** Medium (more complex than 2-opt)
- **Route Complexity:** High (many local loops)

### 4. **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Simple and fast heuristic for constructing an initial solution.
- Best for small to medium-sized problems where speed is crucial.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Low (greedy approach)
- **Problem Size:** Small to Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Low

### 5. **Greedy Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Constructs a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized problems and for quickly generating initial solutions.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Low to Medium (greedy approach)
- **Problem Size:** Small to Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Low to Medium

### 6. **Saving Algorithm**
**Scenario:**
- Good for combining routes to reduce the number of vehicles used.
- Best when vehicle capacity is a significant constraint and merging routes can yield substantial savings.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium
- **Problem Size:** Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Medium (benefit from route merging)

### 7. **Random Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Useful for generating diverse initial solutions quickly.
- Applicable when exploring a wide range of solutions is necessary before applying more refined heuristics.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Low (random approach)
- **Problem Size:** Small to Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Low to Medium

### 8. **Petal Algorithm**
**Scenario:**
- Constructs routes (petals) around the depot, creating loops.
- Effective for problems with a central depot and evenly distributed customer locations.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium
- **Problem Size:** Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Medium (benefit from petal structure)

### 9. **Farthest Insertion Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Focuses on inserting the farthest unvisited node, minimizing the increase in total distance.
- Best for problems where nodes are dispersed, and it’s crucial to manage the farthest nodes early.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium
- **Problem Size:** Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Medium

### 10. **Node Shift Between Routes Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Moves nodes between routes to reduce total distance or balance loads.
- Suitable for improving solutions by balancing vehicle loads or reducing travel distance.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium
- **Problem Size:** Medium to Large
- **Route Complexity:** High (benefit from load balancing)

### 11. **Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic**
**Scenario:**
- Inserts nodes into routes where the increase in total cost is minimized.
- Effective for constructing initial solutions with a focus on cost minimization.

**Quantification:**
- **Initial Solution Quality:** Medium
- **Problem Size:** Medium
- **Route Complexity:** Medium (benefit from cost-focused insertion)

### Summary of Quantification Metrics:

- **Initial Solution Quality:** High, Medium, Low
- **Problem Size:** Small, Medium, Large
- **Route Complexity:** Low, Medium, High

By understanding these scenarios, you can choose the most appropriate heuristic algorithm based on the specific characteristics of the CVRP problem instance you are dealing with. This approach ensures that the chosen algorithm can efficiently generate high-quality solutions.

Before this discuss, we have already 1 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_99ba
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Nearest Neighbor heuristic will help construct an initial feasible solution by iteratively adding the nearest unvisited node to each vehicle's route, respecting capacity constraints. This will provide a good starting point for further improvements.
Delta of Visited Node Num: 10
Delta of Current Cost: 77.0
Delta of Fulfilled Demands: 144

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_neighbor_99ba. How does nearest_neighbor_99ba perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:

   - **Pros:** The nearest_neighbor_99ba heuristic quickly provided a feasible initial solution by visiting 11 nodes, fulfilling 144 demands with a total cost of 77.0.
   - **Cons:** Given the greedy nature of the nearest neighbor heuristic, it might not explore globally optimal solutions and can get stuck in local optima.

2. **Potential Next Steps:**
   - Given the current state, we need to balance the exploration of new routes and the improvement of existing ones.
   - We should consider a heuristic that can both explore new unvisited nodes and optimize the current routes. 

### Recommended Heuristic:
To further refine and explore the solution, I recommend using the **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)** heuristic. This heuristic is effective in escaping local optima by systematically changing the neighborhood structure, which can help in exploring new routes and optimizing existing ones.

### Decision:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: variable_neighborhood_search_614b
running steps: 10
explanation: The Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic will help in both exploring new routes and optimizing the current routes. It systematically changes the neighborhood structure, which can help in escaping local optima and finding better solutions. Given that we have a good initial solution from the nearest neighbor heuristic, VNS can build upon it and potentially improve the overall solution.

Let's proceed with the Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic for 10 steps and then review the performance.
