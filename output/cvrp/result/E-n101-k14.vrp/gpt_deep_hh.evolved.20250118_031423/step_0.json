This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\n\nlocal_search_heuristics: local search heuristics improve an existing solution by making small changes, like 2-opt and 3-opt swaps.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\n\nmetaheuristic_heuristics: sophisticated methods like VNS explore multiple neighborhoods to escape local optima and find better solutions.\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\ninter_route_operators: these heuristics focus on improving solutions by moving nodes between different routes or merging routes.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nnode_num:101\nvehicle_num:14\ncapacity:112\ndepot:0\ndemands:[0, 10, 7, 13, 19, 26, 3, 5, 9, 16, 16, 12, 19, 23, 20, 8, 19, 2, 12, 17, 9, 11, 18, 29, 3, 6, 17, 16, 16, 9, 21, 27, 23, 11, 14, 8, 5, 8, 16, 31, 9, 5, 5, 7, 18, 16, 1, 27, 36, 30, 13, 10, 9, 14, 18, 2, 6, 7, 18, 28, 3, 13, 19, 10, 9, 20, 25, 25, 36, 6, 5, 15, 25, 9, 8, 18, 13, 14, 3, 23, 6, 26, 16, 11, 7, 41, 35, 26, 9, 15, 3, 1, 2, 22, 27, 20, 11, 12, 10, 9, 17]\naverage_demand:14.435643564356436\ndemand_variance:79.21615527889422\naverage_distance:33.9160396039604\nmax_distance:92.0\nmin_distance:1.0\ndistance_variance:267.38780213704536\nvehicle_capacity_utilization:0.9298469387755102\nnode_to_vehicle_ratio:7.214285714285714\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 5 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a framework to guide the process:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n- **Objective**: Build a feasible initial solution quickly.\n- **Heuristic Categories**: Constructive Heuristics\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. **Select a Constructive Heuristic**: \n     - Start with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to quickly generate an initial feasible solution.\n     - Evaluate performance based on initial cost and feasibility.\n  2. **Test and Evaluate**:\n     - If the initial solution is suboptimal, switch to `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` for potentially better solutions.\n     - Use `greedy_f4c4` or `petal_algorithm_b384` to explore diverse initial solutions, providing different starting points for improvement.\n  3. **Alternate Between Heuristics**:\n     - Use a different constructive heuristic if the initial one does not yield satisfactory results, to diversify the solution space.\n\n#### Phase 2: Local Search for Improvement\n- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution to reduce cost or improve quality.\n- **Heuristic Categories**: Local Search Heuristics\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. **Select a Local Search Heuristic**:\n     - Begin with `two_opt_0554` for simple route refinements.\n     - Transition to `three_opt_e8d7` for more complex improvements if needed.\n  2. **Iterative Improvement**:\n     - Apply the selected heuristic iteratively, focusing on reducing total route cost.\n     - Monitor improvements and switch to more sophisticated methods if local optima are reached quickly.\n\n#### Phase 3: Metaheuristic Exploration\n- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore broader solution space.\n- **Heuristic Categories**: Metaheuristic Heuristics\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. **Apply Metaheuristic**:\n     - Implement `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` to explore multiple neighborhood structures.\n     - Focus on escaping local optima and discovering new promising regions in the solution space.\n  2. **Adapt and Iterate**:\n     - Adjust parameters or switch heuristics based on performance metrics.\n     - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of exploration strategies and refine them.\n\n#### Phase 4: Inter-Route Optimization\n- **Objective**: Optimize route interactions and balance loads.\n- **Heuristic Categories**: Inter-Route Operators\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. **Select Inter-Route Heuristic**:\n     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` to balance loads and improve route efficiency.\n     - Apply `saving_algorithm_710e` to consolidate routes and reduce overall distance.\n  2. **Evaluate Impact**:\n     - Assess improvements in load balance and cost reduction.\n     - Iterate on successful operators, and consider combining multiple strategies for comprehensive optimization.\n\n### General Guidelines\n- **Iterative Process**: Alternate between heuristics and phases to continuously refine solutions.\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Use key metrics (e.g., total cost, load balance) to evaluate heuristic effectiveness.\n- **Diversity in Approach**: Avoid reliance on a single heuristic; instead, combine different strategies to enhance robustness.\n- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Be prepared to adjust the strategy based on solution performance and specific problem characteristics.\n\nBy following this guide, you'll be able to strategically select and apply heuristics to effectively tackle the CVRP, ensuring comprehensive exploration and optimization of solutions."
