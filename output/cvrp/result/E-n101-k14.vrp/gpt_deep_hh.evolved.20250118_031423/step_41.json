This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.\ndef min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.\ndef nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.\ndef greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.\ndef petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.\n\nlocal_search_heuristics: local search heuristics improve an existing solution by making small changes, like 2-opt and 3-opt swaps.\ndef three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\ndef two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\n\nmetaheuristic_heuristics: sophisticated methods like VNS explore multiple neighborhoods to escape local optima and find better solutions.\ndef variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.\n\ninter_route_operators: these heuristics focus on improving solutions by moving nodes between different routes or merging routes.\ndef node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.\ndef saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nnode_num:101\nvehicle_num:14\ncapacity:112\ndepot:0\ndemands:[0, 10, 7, 13, 19, 26, 3, 5, 9, 16, 16, 12, 19, 23, 20, 8, 19, 2, 12, 17, 9, 11, 18, 29, 3, 6, 17, 16, 16, 9, 21, 27, 23, 11, 14, 8, 5, 8, 16, 31, 9, 5, 5, 7, 18, 16, 1, 27, 36, 30, 13, 10, 9, 14, 18, 2, 6, 7, 18, 28, 3, 13, 19, 10, 9, 20, 25, 25, 36, 6, 5, 15, 25, 9, 8, 18, 13, 14, 3, 23, 6, 26, 16, 11, 7, 41, 35, 26, 9, 15, 3, 1, 2, 22, 27, 20, 11, 12, 10, 9, 17]\naverage_demand:14.435643564356436\ndemand_variance:79.21615527889422\naverage_distance:33.9160396039604\nmax_distance:92.0\nmin_distance:1.0\ndistance_variance:267.38780213704536\nvehicle_capacity_utilization:0.9298469387755102\nnode_to_vehicle_ratio:7.214285714285714\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 5 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Starting with a constructive heuristic will allow us to build a foundational solution by incrementally adding nodes to vehicle routes, which is crucial at this initial stage.\nVisited Node Num: 1->6\nCurrent Cost: 0.0->38.0\nFulfilled Demands: 0->72\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9\nHeuristic Category: constructive_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  The initial solution is still in its early stages, with only 6 nodes visited out of 101. Continuing with a constructive heuristic will allow you to build upon the existing foundation by adding more nodes to the vehicle routes. This will help in achieving a more comprehensive initial solution before moving on to local search or metaheuristic methods for refinement.\nVisited Node Num: 6->11\nCurrent Cost: 38.0->77.0\nFulfilled Demands: 72->154\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: constructive_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  The current solution has only visited 11 out of 101 nodes, indicating that the initial solution is still under development. Continuing with a constructive heuristic will allow us to incrementally add more nodes to the vehicle routes, enhancing the coverage of the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has already demonstrated progress by increasing the number of visited nodes and fulfilling more demands. Continuing with the constructive approach will further build on this progress, ensuring a more comprehensive initial solution before moving on to more sophisticated improvement methods. Once the solution is closer to completion, we can then transition to local search or metaheuristic techniques for refinement and optimization.\nVisited Node Num: 11->16\nCurrent Cost: 77.0->97.0\nFulfilled Demands: 154->220\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: three_opt_e8d7\nHeuristic Category: local_search_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has made some progress by visiting 16 nodes, but a significant number of nodes (85) remain unvisited. While the constructive heuristics have helped in building an initial feasible solution, it's now crucial to focus on optimizing and refining this solution. By switching to local search heuristics, we can make small, targeted improvements to the current routes, potentially reducing the total cost and increasing efficiency. This approach will help in maximizing the utility of the existing solution while preparing it for further enhancements through metaheuristic methods later on.\nVisited Node Num: 16->16\nCurrent Cost: 97.0->96.0\nFulfilled Demands: 220->220\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: petal_algorithm_b384\nHeuristic Category: constructive_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain:  The current solution has only visited 16 nodes, leaving a significant number of nodes (85) unvisited. This suggests that while some local optimizations have been made, the overall solution is still in its early stages of development. Returning to constructive heuristics will allow us to incrementally add more nodes to the routes, aiming to build a more comprehensive initial solution.

Continuing with local search heuristics, such as 2-opt or 3-opt, will help refine the existing solution by optimizing the current routes, potentially reducing the overall cost and improving vehicle load distribution. This approach targets enhancing the solution quality before revisiting constructive or metaheuristic methods for further exploration.\nVisited Node Num: 21->21\nCurrent Cost: 157.0->157.0\nFulfilled Demands: 273->273\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: petal_algorithm_b384\nHeuristic Category: constructive_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has only visited 21 nodes out of 101, leaving a significant number of nodes unvisited. While local search heuristics have been applied to optimize the existing routes, there is still a need to incorporate more nodes into the solution to fulfill remaining demands. Returning to constructive heuristics will allow us to incrementally add unvisited nodes to the routes, aiming to build a more comprehensive initial solution. Once a larger portion of the nodes is visited, we can revisit local search or metaheuristic approaches to further refine and optimize the solution.\nVisited Node Num: 21->26\nCurrent Cost: 157.0->188.0\nFulfilled Demands: 273->324\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: greedy_f4c4\nHeuristic Category: constructive_heuristics\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: The current solution has visited only 26 out of 101 nodes, leaving a significant number of nodes unvisited. The constructive heuristics have incrementally improved the solution by adding more nodes to the routes, but the coverage is still insufficient.

If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\nEnsure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.\nIf you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***."

However, the total cost of 1236.0 suggests there might be room for further optimization in terms of route efficiency and cost reduction. Switching to the inter-route operators category can help optimize the allocation of nodes between routes, improve load balance, and potentially reduce the overall cost. This approach can address any remaining inefficiencies in vehicle utilization and route distribution, providing strategic enhancements to the existing solution.\n***"
