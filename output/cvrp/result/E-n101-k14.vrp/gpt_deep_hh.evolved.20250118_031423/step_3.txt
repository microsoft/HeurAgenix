I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on cvrp problem:
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an optimization challenge focused on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to various locations, considering vehicle capacity constraints.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of CVRP.
A list of lists where each sublist represents a vehicle's route.
Each sublist contains integers representing the nodes (customers) visited by the vehicle in the order of visitation.
The routes are sorted by vehicle identifier and the nodes in the list sorted by visited order."""
    def __init__(self, routes: list[list[int]], depot: int):
        self.routes = routes
        self.depot = depot
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Append a node at the end of the specified vehicle's route."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].append(self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node at a specified position within the route of a specified vehicle."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, node: int, position: int):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.node = node
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_routes = [route[:] for route in solution.routes]
        new_routes[self.vehicle_id].insert(self.position, self.node)
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap two nodes between or within vehicle routes."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id1: int, position1: int, vehicle_id2: int, position2: int):
        if vehicle_id1 <= vehicle_id2:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.vehicle_id2 = vehicle_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.vehicle_id1 = vehicle_id2
            self.position1 = position2

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        (new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1], new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2]) = (new_routes[self.vehicle_id2][self.position2], new_routes[self.vehicle_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverse multiple segments of indices in the solution."""
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

                new_route = list(reversed(new_route[start_index:])) + new_route[end_index + 1:start_index] + list(reversed(new_route[:end_index + 1]))
        new_routes = solution.routes[:self.vehicle_id] + [new_route] + solution.routes[self.vehicle_id + 1:]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:

        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)
class MergeRoutesOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Merge two routes by appending the route of the source vehicle to the beginning of the route of the target vehicle. 
The merged route is assigned to the target vehicle, and the source vehicle's route is cleared."""

        new_routes[self.source_vehicle_id] = [solution.depot]
        return Solution(new_routes, solution.depot)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

    - "vehicle_num" (int): The total number of vehicles.
    - "capacity" (int): The capacity for each vehicle and all vehicles share the same value.
    - "depot" (int): The index for depot node.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): constructive_heuristics,local_search_heuristics,metaheuristic_heuristics,inter_route_operators

constructive_heuristics: constructive heuristics are used to build initial solutions from scratch by adding nodes incrementally.
def farthest_insertion_6308(): Farthest Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Improvements for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This heuristic algorithm selects unvisited nodes based on a scoring mechanism that considers insertion cost, route compactness, and vehicle capacity utilization. It periodically performs greedy improvements and inter-vehicle swaps to enhance the solution.
def min_cost_insertion_3b2b(): Optimized Min-Cost Insertion Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic algorithm is optimized for performance by restructuring the order of operations, adjusting hyper-parameters, and implementing efficient logic to enhance the solution.
def nearest_neighbor_54a9(): Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic prioritizes nodes with higher demands that can fit into the vehicle's remaining capacity, especially when the number of unvisited nodes is low. It also periodically applies a 2-opt heuristic to improve route compactness.
def greedy_f4c4(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the closest unvisited node to a vehicle's route until all nodes are visited or the vehicle reaches its capacity. It starts with an empty route for each vehicle and selects nodes based on the shortest distance from the last node in the route.
def petal_algorithm_b384(): Petal construction heuristic algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic attempts to build feasible routes (petals) around the depot and combine them into a set of vehicle routes. Each petal starts and ends at the depot, creating a loop that can serve as an individual route for a vehicle.

local_search_heuristics: local search heuristics improve an existing solution by making small changes, like 2-opt and 3-opt swaps.
def three_opt_e8d7(): Implements a 3-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
def two_opt_0554(): Implements a 2-opt heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

metaheuristic_heuristics: sophisticated methods like VNS explore multiple neighborhoods to escape local optima and find better solutions.
def variable_neighborhood_search_614b(): Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm for CVRP. This function performs a Variable Neighborhood Search by systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a local search algorithm to escape local optima and search for better solutions. It uses a series of pre-defined operators to create new neighborhoods and improve upon the current solution.

inter_route_operators: these heuristics focus on improving solutions by moving nodes between different routes or merging routes.
def node_shift_between_routes_7b8a(): Node Shift Between Routes heuristic for CVRP. This heuristic attempts to move a node from one route to another route, aiming to reduce the total distance or improve load balance. It considers the capacity constraints and ensures that the move is beneficial before applying it.
def saving_algorithm_710e(merge_threshold: float = 0.0): Saving Algorithm heuristic for CVRP. Calculates savings for combining two routes into one for each pair of end nodes of existing routes and sorts these savings in descending order. Routes are then merged by the highest savings while considering vehicle capacity constraints.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:
node_num:101
vehicle_num:14
capacity:112
depot:0
demands:[0, 10, 7, 13, 19, 26, 3, 5, 9, 16, 16, 12, 19, 23, 20, 8, 19, 2, 12, 17, 9, 11, 18, 29, 3, 6, 17, 16, 16, 9, 21, 27, 23, 11, 14, 8, 5, 8, 16, 31, 9, 5, 5, 7, 18, 16, 1, 27, 36, 30, 13, 10, 9, 14, 18, 2, 6, 7, 18, 28, 3, 13, 19, 10, 9, 20, 25, 25, 36, 6, 5, 15, 25, 9, 8, 18, 13, 14, 3, 23, 6, 26, 16, 11, 7, 41, 35, 26, 9, 15, 3, 1, 2, 22, 27, 20, 11, 12, 10, 9, 17]
average_demand:14.435643564356436
demand_variance:79.21615527889422
average_distance:33.9160396039604
max_distance:92.0
min_distance:1.0
distance_variance:267.38780213704536
vehicle_capacity_utilization:0.9298469387755102
node_to_vehicle_ratio:7.214285714285714

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 5 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase of solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) requires a structured approach. Here's a framework to guide the process:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective**: Build a feasible initial solution quickly.
- **Heuristic Categories**: Constructive Heuristics
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. **Select a Constructive Heuristic**: 
     - Start with `nearest_neighbor_54a9` to quickly generate an initial feasible solution.
     - Evaluate performance based on initial cost and feasibility.
  2. **Test and Evaluate**:
     - If the initial solution is suboptimal, switch to `farthest_insertion_6308` or `min_cost_insertion_3b2b` for potentially better solutions.
     - Use `greedy_f4c4` or `petal_algorithm_b384` to explore diverse initial solutions, providing different starting points for improvement.
  3. **Alternate Between Heuristics**:
     - Use a different constructive heuristic if the initial one does not yield satisfactory results, to diversify the solution space.

#### Phase 2: Local Search for Improvement
- **Objective**: Refine the initial solution to reduce cost or improve quality.
- **Heuristic Categories**: Local Search Heuristics
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. **Select a Local Search Heuristic**:
     - Begin with `two_opt_0554` for simple route refinements.
     - Transition to `three_opt_e8d7` for more complex improvements if needed.
  2. **Iterative Improvement**:
     - Apply the selected heuristic iteratively, focusing on reducing total route cost.
     - Monitor improvements and switch to more sophisticated methods if local optima are reached quickly.

#### Phase 3: Metaheuristic Exploration
- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore broader solution space.
- **Heuristic Categories**: Metaheuristic Heuristics
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. **Apply Metaheuristic**:
     - Implement `variable_neighborhood_search_614b` to explore multiple neighborhood structures.
     - Focus on escaping local optima and discovering new promising regions in the solution space.
  2. **Adapt and Iterate**:
     - Adjust parameters or switch heuristics based on performance metrics.
     - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of exploration strategies and refine them.

#### Phase 4: Inter-Route Optimization
- **Objective**: Optimize route interactions and balance loads.
- **Heuristic Categories**: Inter-Route Operators
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. **Select Inter-Route Heuristic**:
     - Use `node_shift_between_routes_7b8a` to balance loads and improve route efficiency.
     - Apply `saving_algorithm_710e` to consolidate routes and reduce overall distance.
  2. **Evaluate Impact**:
     - Assess improvements in load balance and cost reduction.
     - Iterate on successful operators, and consider combining multiple strategies for comprehensive optimization.

### General Guidelines
- **Iterative Process**: Alternate between heuristics and phases to continuously refine solutions.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use key metrics (e.g., total cost, load balance) to evaluate heuristic effectiveness.
- **Diversity in Approach**: Avoid reliance on a single heuristic; instead, combine different strategies to enhance robustness.
- **Flexibility and Adaptation**: Be prepared to adjust the strategy based on solution performance and specific problem characteristics.

By following this guide, you'll be able to strategically select and apply heuristics to effectively tackle the CVRP, ensuring comprehensive exploration and optimization of solutions.

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: min_cost_insertion_3b2b
Heuristic Category: constructive_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  Since the current solution only consists of vehicles returning to the depot without visiting any nodes, it indicates that we need to construct an initial feasible solution. Starting with a constructive heuristic will allow us to build a foundational solution by incrementally adding nodes to vehicle routes, which is crucial at this initial stage.
Visited Node Num: 1->6
Current Cost: 0.0->38.0
Fulfilled Demands: 0->72
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_neighbor_54a9
Heuristic Category: constructive_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The initial solution is still in its early stages, with only 6 nodes visited out of 101. Continuing with a constructive heuristic will allow you to build upon the existing foundation by adding more nodes to the vehicle routes. This will help in achieving a more comprehensive initial solution before moving on to local search or metaheuristic methods for refinement.
Visited Node Num: 6->11
Current Cost: 38.0->77.0
Fulfilled Demands: 72->154
---Round 2---
Heuristic: greedy_f4c4
Heuristic Category: constructive_heuristics
Running Steps: 5
Explain:  The current solution has only visited 11 out of 101 nodes, indicating that the initial solution is still under development. Continuing with a constructive heuristic will allow us to incrementally add more nodes to the vehicle routes, enhancing the coverage of the solution. The `nearest_neighbor_54a9` heuristic has already demonstrated progress by increasing the number of visited nodes and fulfilling more demands. Continuing with the constructive approach will further build on this progress, ensuring a more comprehensive initial solution before moving on to more sophisticated improvement methods. Once the solution is closer to completion, we can then transition to local search or metaheuristic techniques for refinement and optimization.
Visited Node Num: 11->16
Current Cost: 77.0->97.0
Fulfilled Demands: 154->220

total_remaining_demand:1238
solution_validity:True
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: greedy_f4c4(constructive_heuristics). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: constructive_heuristics,local_search_heuristics,metaheuristic_heuristics,inter_route_operators

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:local_search_heuristics
explanation:The current solution has made some progress by visiting 16 nodes, but a significant number of nodes (85) remain unvisited. While the constructive heuristics have helped in building an initial feasible solution, it's now crucial to focus on optimizing and refining this solution. By switching to local search heuristics, we can make small, targeted improvements to the current routes, potentially reducing the total cost and increasing efficiency. This approach will help in maximizing the utility of the existing solution while preparing it for further enhancements through metaheuristic methods later on.
