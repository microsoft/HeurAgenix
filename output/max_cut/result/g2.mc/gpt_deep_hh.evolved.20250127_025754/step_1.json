I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "To effectively tackle the MaxCut problem using the heuristics you have developed, it's important to strategically select and apply different categories of heuristics across various phases of the solution process. Below is a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Construction\n\n- **Objective**: Quickly establish a feasible initial solution.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Node-Based Selection**: Begin with a random node selection to get an initial partition. This can be achieved through the `random_5c59` heuristic, which provides a baseline solution without any assumptions.\n  - **Edge-Based**: Use `highest_weight_edge_ca02` to guide initial node placements based on edge weights, ensuring the initial solution has a decent cut value.\n\n### Phase 2: Balancing and Basic Optimization\n\n- **Objective**: Improve the solution by balancing the partitions and enhancing the cut value.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Balanced Partition**: Implement `balanced_cut_c0e6` to maintain a balanced partition while improving the cut value.\n  - **Node-Based Selection**: Apply `highest_delta_node_b31b` to refine the node placements by evaluating individual contributions to the cut value.\n\n### Phase 3: Enhanced Optimization\n\n- **Objective**: Further optimize the solution by exploring more complex moves.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Swap Optimization**: Use `greedy_swap_5bb5` for incremental improvements through swaps. Follow with `multi_swap_2_dbfe` to explore more substantial changes by swapping pairs of nodes.\n  - **Edge-Based**: Revisit `highest_delta_edge_9f66` to ensure that all significant edges are contributing effectively to the cut value.\n\n### Phase 4: Exploration and Escape from Local Optima\n\n- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore the solution space more broadly.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Annealing-Based**: Implement `simulated_annealing_ed14` to probabilistically explore the solution space and escape local optima, allowing for temporary acceptance of worse solutions for the potential of discovering better configurations.\n\n### Execution Strategy\n\n1. **Iterative Testing**: Begin with one heuristic from the initial construction phase, evaluate its performance, and switch to another heuristic if improvements stagnate.\n2. **Cross-Category Moves**: Alternate between categories, like starting with node-based selection, moving to edge-based strategies, and then incorporating swaps and annealing-based approaches.\n3. **Performance Evaluation**: After each heuristic is applied, evaluate the cut value and partition balance. Use these metrics to decide whether to continue with the current heuristic or switch to another.\n4. **Adaptive Strategy**: Be prepared to adapt the strategy based on the problem's characteristics and the heuristics' performance. If a heuristic is consistently outperforming others, consider prioritizing it but remain open to integrating other heuristics as needed.\n\nThis strategic guide provides a framework for systematically exploring and applying different heuristic categories, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive approach to solving the MaxCut problem. The goal is to leverage the strengths of various heuristics at different stages, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the solution space."
