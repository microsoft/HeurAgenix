I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Below is a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase:\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Construction\n\n- **Objective**: Quickly establish a feasible initial solution.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Node-Based Selection**: Begin with a random node selection to get an initial partition. This can be achieved through the `random_5c59` heuristic, which provides a baseline solution without any assumptions.\n  - **Edge-Based**: Use `highest_weight_edge_ca02` to guide initial node placements based on edge weights, ensuring the initial solution has a decent cut value.\n\n### Phase 2: Balancing and Basic Optimization\n\n- **Objective**: Improve the solution by balancing the partitions and enhancing the cut value.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Balanced Partition**: Implement `balanced_cut_c0e6` to maintain a balanced partition while improving the cut value.\n  - **Node-Based Selection**: Apply `highest_delta_node_b31b` to refine the node placements by evaluating individual contributions to the cut value.\n\n### Phase 3: Enhanced Optimization\n\n- **Objective**: Further optimize the solution by exploring more complex moves.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Swap Optimization**: Use `greedy_swap_5bb5` for incremental improvements through swaps. Follow with `multi_swap_2_dbfe` to explore more substantial changes by swapping pairs of nodes.\n  - **Edge-Based**: Revisit `highest_delta_edge_9f66` to ensure that all significant edges are contributing effectively to the cut value.\n\n### Phase 4: Exploration and Escape from Local Optima\n\n- **Objective**: Escape local optima and explore the solution space more broadly.\n- **Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Annealing-Based**: Implement `simulated_annealing_ed14` to probabilistically explore the solution space and escape local optima, allowing for temporary acceptance of worse solutions for the potential of discovering better configurations.\n\n### Execution Strategy\n\n1. **Iterative Testing**: Begin with one heuristic from the initial construction phase, evaluate its performance, and switch to another heuristic if improvements stagnate.\n2. **Cross-Category Moves**: Alternate between categories, like starting with node-based selection, moving to edge-based strategies, and then incorporating swaps and annealing-based approaches.\n3. **Performance Evaluation**: After each heuristic is applied, evaluate the cut value and partition balance. Use these metrics to decide whether to continue with the current heuristic or switch to another.\n4. **Adaptive Strategy**: Be prepared to adapt the strategy based on the problem's characteristics and the heuristics' performance. If a heuristic is consistently outperforming others, consider prioritizing it but remain open to integrating other heuristics as needed.\n\nThis strategic guide provides a framework for systematically exploring and applying different heuristic categories, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive approach to solving the MaxCut problem. The goal is to leverage the strengths of various heuristics at different stages, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the solution space."

This approach allows us to quickly generate a starting point for further optimization.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: node_based_selection\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since we have only one node selected and no edges contributing to the cut value yet, it would be beneficial to continue with a node-based selection heuristic to build a more substantial initial partition. Continuing with this category will allow us to incrementally add nodes to the partitions and potentially start seeing some edges contributing to the cut value. Once we have more nodes placed, we can evaluate switching to other categories like edge-based or balanced partition for optimization.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: edge_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  With an initial partition established and a slight increase in cut value, it's beneficial to switch to an edge-based heuristic. This approach will help identify nodes whose placement can maximize the cut value by focusing on the potential contributions of edges. Given the low edge density and uniform edge weights, edge-based heuristics like `highest_weight_edge_ca02` can effectively guide further development of the solution by strategically placing additional nodes to maximize the cut value.\nSelected Node: 2->3\nCut Value: 1.0->2.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: balanced_partition\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has a slight imbalance between set A and set B, and the cut value is still relatively low compared to the potential maximum. Switching to the balanced_partition category will help ensure a more evenly distributed node placement, which can contribute to a higher cut value by leveraging more edges between the sets. This approach will also address the imbalance ratio and improve the overall solution quality.\nSelected Node: 3->3\nCut Value: 2.0->1.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: highest_weight_edge_ca02\nHeuristic Category: edge_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution shows a slight imbalance between the partitions, with only a small portion of nodes selected and a low cut value. Given the uniform edge weights and the need to increase the cut value, switching to an edge-based heuristic can help identify key nodes that maximize the cut value. By focusing on the potential contributions of edges, an edge-based approach will strategically place additional nodes to enhance the solution and increase the cut value.\nSelected Node: 3->4\nCut Value: 1.0->3.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: balanced_partition\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  With a current cut value of 3.0 and only a small portion of nodes selected, it's important to address the partition balance and potentially increase the cut value. The imbalance ratio is 0.0, indicating a perfectly balanced partition, but there is room to incorporate more nodes strategically. Continuing with a balanced_partition heuristic can help ensure that as additional nodes are added, the partition remains balanced, potentially leveraging more edges between sets and thus increasing the cut value.\nSelected Node: 4->5\nCut Value: 3.0->4.0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: highest_weight_edge_ca02\nHeuristic Category: edge_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, there is a relatively low number of selected nodes and a modest cut value. The partitions are fairly balanced, but the potential for increasing the cut value by focusing on strategic edge placements remains high. An edge-based heuristic can help identify which unselected nodes, when added, will most effectively increase the cut value by leveraging the existing edges between the sets.\nSelected Node: 5->7\nCut Value: 4.0->10.0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nHeuristic Category: swap_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution has a relatively low number of selected nodes with a modest cut value, and the partitions are fairly balanced. To further enhance the solution, it may be beneficial to explore swap optimization. Swap-based heuristics can evaluate potential node exchanges between the two sets, potentially increasing the cut value by optimizing the boundary between the partitions. This approach can leverage the current balance and focus on refining the cut value by considering swaps that yield the highest gains.\nSelected Node: 7->7\nCut Value: 10.0->10.0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nHeuristic Category: annealing_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution shows a modest cut value with a relatively small number of selected nodes. The partitions are fairly balanced, but there is potential to further explore the solution space and escape local optima. Switching to the annealing-based category will allow probabilistic exploration and potential acceptance of worse solutions temporarily, which could lead to discovering a more optimal configuration. This approach can help navigate the solution space more freely and potentially uncover significant improvements.\nSelected Node: 7->7\nCut Value: 10.0->10.0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nHeuristic Category: swap_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current solution state with a modest cut value and fairly balanced partitions, swap optimization could be beneficial. Since the simulated annealing didn't yield further improvements, focusing on swap-based heuristics might help refine node placements between the sets to enhance the cut value. This approach can target specific boundary nodes for potential gains in the cut value, leveraging the current balance to optimize further.\nSelected Node: 7->7\nCut Value: 10.0->10.0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balanced_partition\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, the partitions are slightly imbalanced, and the cut value has not improved in recent iterations despite attempts with swap optimization and annealing. A balanced partition heuristic like `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` could help maintain an even distribution while potentially increasing the cut value by strategically adding nodes. This approach can leverage the low imbalance ratio and focus on further optimizing the partitioning to enhance the solution.\nSelected Node: 7->8\nCut Value: 10.0->10.0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: edge_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution shows a balanced partition with a cut value that hasn't improved in the last few iterations. Given the uniform edge weights and low edge density, revisiting an edge-based heuristic could help identify and place unselected nodes that maximize the cut value, focusing on strategic edge contributions to improve the cut.\nSelected Node: 8->9\nCut Value: 10.0->13.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 97,101,9,300,18\nset_b: 176,1,667,65\n\nset_a_count:5\nset_b_count:4\nselected_nodes:{65, 97, 1, 101, 9, 300, 176, 18, 667}\nselected_num:9\nunselected_num:791\ncurrent_cut_value:13.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.00125\ncut_value:13.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:1.4444444444444444\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.01125\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.98875\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0.05859375\nboundary_node_ratio:0.01125\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: highest_delta_edge_9f66(edge_based).
