I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

***is_cop:yes***

MaxCut is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, and it can be effectively approached with heuristic methods. Your framework for handling solutions and operators seems to align with standard practices for developing heuristic algorithms, making it suitable for tackling the MaxCut problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves considering the characteristics of the problem instance and the strengths of each heuristic. Here are some insights on potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Balanced Cut (balanced_cut_c0e6):**
   - **Scenario:** When the problem requires a balanced partition, meaning the number of nodes in each subset should be approximately equal. This heuristic is suitable for graphs where balance is crucial for maintaining other constraints or achieving a more equitable solution.

2. **Highest Weight Edge (highest_weight_edge_ca02):**
   - **Scenario:** Best applied when edges have significantly varying weights and maximizing the cut value quickly is essential. It focuses on the most impactful edges, making it suitable for dense graphs with a few high-weight edges.

3. **Most Weight Neighbors (most_weight_neighbors_d31b):**
   - **Scenario:** Applicable in situations where both immediate and future impacts need to be considered, especially in dynamic environments where the graph might change over time. The swap frequency parameter allows for periodic optimization, making it suitable for iterative improvement processes.

4. **Greedy Swap (greedy_swap_5bb5):**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is effective for fine-tuning an existing solution, especially when small adjustments can lead to significant improvements. It's suitable for scenarios where rapid iterations are necessary, and the graph has a relatively stable structure.

5. **Highest Delta Edge (highest_delta_edge_9f66):**
   - **Scenario:** Useful in scenarios where the goal is to quickly achieve a high cut value by focusing on the most beneficial unselected edges. It works well in sparse graphs where individual edge selections can significantly impact the overall solution.

6. **Highest Delta Node (highest_delta_node_b31b):**
   - **Scenario:** Best suited for graphs where nodes have varying degrees of connectivity, and the goal is to maximize the cut incrementally by adding nodes. It’s appropriate for scenarios where node-centric strategies are more effective than edge-centric ones.

7. **Multi Swap 2 (multi_swap_2_dbfe):**
   - **Scenario:** Applicable in scenarios where complex interactions between node pairs are significant, and single swaps aren't sufficient to achieve optimal solutions. It's suitable for dense graphs where multiple interactions need to be considered simultaneously.

8. **Random (random_5c59):**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is useful for generating initial solutions or exploring the solution space in an unbiased manner. It’s appropriate for large graphs where deterministic strategies might get stuck in local optima.

9. **Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing_ed14):**
   - **Scenario:** Ideal for escaping local optima by allowing worse solutions initially, with a cooling schedule to refine the solution over time. It's well-suited for complex graphs with rugged solution landscapes, where exploration and exploitation need to be balanced.

Each of these heuristics is applicable based on specific graph characteristics, solution requirements, and computational constraints. Selecting the right heuristic often depends on a combination of problem understanding, empirical testing, and computational resources.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Since a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: random_5c59
running steps: 100
explanation: Since there is no initial solution (set_a and set_b are both empty) and the edge weights are uniform, starting with a random insertion heuristic can help to quickly explore the solution space and create an initial partition of the nodes. This will provide a base for more refined heuristics to work on in subsequent steps.
