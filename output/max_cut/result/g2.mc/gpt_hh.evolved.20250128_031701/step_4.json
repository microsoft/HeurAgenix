                "text": "Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves considering the characteristics of the problem instance and the strengths of each heuristic. Here are some insights on potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **Balanced Cut (balanced_cut_c0e6):**\n   - **Scenario:** When the problem requires a balanced partition, meaning the number of nodes in each subset should be approximately equal. This heuristic is suitable for graphs where balance is crucial for maintaining other constraints or achieving a more equitable solution.\n\n2. **Highest Weight Edge (highest_weight_edge_ca02):**\n   - **Scenario:** Best applied when edges have significantly varying weights and maximizing the cut value quickly is essential. It focuses on the most impactful edges, making it suitable for dense graphs with a few high-weight edges.\n\n3. **Most Weight Neighbors (most_weight_neighbors_d31b):**\n   - **Scenario:** Applicable in situations where both immediate and future impacts need to be considered, especially in dynamic environments where the graph might change over time. The swap frequency parameter allows for periodic optimization, making it suitable for iterative improvement processes.\n\n4. **Greedy Swap (greedy_swap_5bb5):**\n   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is effective for fine-tuning an existing solution, especially when small adjustments can lead to significant improvements. It's suitable for scenarios where rapid iterations are necessary, and the graph has a relatively stable structure.\n\n5. **Highest Delta Edge (highest_delta_edge_9f66):**\n   - **Scenario:** Useful in scenarios where the goal is to quickly achieve a high cut value by focusing on the most beneficial unselected edges. It works well in sparse graphs where individual edge selections can significantly impact the overall solution.\n\n6. **Highest Delta Node (highest_delta_node_b31b):**\n   - **Scenario:** Best suited for graphs where nodes have varying degrees of connectivity, and the goal is to maximize the cut incrementally by adding nodes. It\u2019s appropriate for scenarios where node-centric strategies are more effective than edge-centric ones.\n\n7. **Multi Swap 2 (multi_swap_2_dbfe):**\n   - **Scenario:** Applicable in scenarios where complex interactions between node pairs are significant, and single swaps aren't sufficient to achieve optimal solutions. It's suitable for dense graphs where multiple interactions need to be considered simultaneously.\n\n8. **Random (random_5c59):**\n   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is useful for generating initial solutions or exploring the solution space in an unbiased manner. It\u2019s appropriate for large graphs where deterministic strategies might get stuck in local optima.\n\n9. **Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing_ed14):**\n   - **Scenario:** Ideal for escaping local optima by allowing worse solutions initially, with a cooling schedule to refine the solution over time. It's well-suited for complex graphs with rugged solution landscapes, where exploration and exploitation need to be balanced.\n\nEach of these heuristics is applicable based on specific graph characteristics, solution requirements, and computational constraints. Selecting the right heuristic often depends on a combination of problem understanding, empirical testing, and computational resources."

This will provide a base for more refined heuristics to work on in subsequent steps.\nDelta of Selected Node: 100\nDelta of Cut Value: 124.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: Given that the initial random heuristic has already provided a partition with a significant cut value, employing the Greedy Swap heuristic can help fine-tune the solution by exploring possible single-node swaps that maximize the cut value. This heuristic is well-suited for making incremental improvements, especially in a scenario with uniform edge weights and a balanced partition.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 93.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic has already demonstrated its ability to significantly increase the cut value in the previous round. Given the current state data, where the imbalance ratio is low and the cut value is progressing well, continuing with this heuristic for more steps can further refine the solution by exploring more potential swaps. Since the edge weights are uniform, greedy_swap_5bb5 can effectively optimize the partition by focusing on maximizing the cut incrementally.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: Given that the greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic has reached a plateau with no improvement in the cut value during the last round, it may be beneficial to switch to simulated annealing. This heuristic is well-suited for escaping local optima by probabilistically accepting worse solutions early on, which could lead to discovering a better overall solution. The uniform edge weights and the current balanced partition suggest that exploring different configurations could yield improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: -22.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: simulated_annealing_ed14. How does simulated_annealing_ed14 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
