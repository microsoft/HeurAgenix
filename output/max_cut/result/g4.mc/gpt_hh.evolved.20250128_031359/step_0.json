Given the uniformity of edge weights and the sparsity of the graph, a heuristic that focuses on node placement rather than edge weights would be appropriate. \n\nThe **highest_weight_edge_ca02** heuristic might be less effective here due to uniform edge weights. Instead, a heuristic like **random_5c59**, which can quickly generate an initial solution, or **most_weight_neighbors_d31b**, which considers node neighborhoods, would be suitable to break the initial symmetry and begin constructing a solution.\n\nHowever, since edge weights are uniform, a simple random approach could provide a diverse starting point.
