The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.\ndef highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.\n\nbalancing: These heuristics attempt to maintain a balance between sets while maximizing cut value, considering both immediate and future impacts.\ndef balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.\ndef most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.\n\nswap_based: These heuristics focus on improving the solution by swapping nodes between sets to increase the cut value.\ndef greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.\ndef multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.\n\nprobabilistic: This heuristic uses probabilistic decision-making to potentially escape local optima, accepting worse solutions early on with decreasing probability over time.\ndef simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nnode_num:800\naverage_node_degree:47.94\nedge_density:0.06\naverage_edge_weight:1.0\nmax_edge_weight:1.0\nmin_edge_weight:1.0\nstandard_deviation_edge_weight:0.0\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a proposed strategy:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Initialization Phase\n- **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible solution to serve as a starting point.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**: \n  - **Greedy**: Start with a simple greedy heuristic that can provide a baseline solution.\n    - Execution Step: Use `highest_weight_edge_ca02` to assign nodes to sets by maximizing immediate cut weight.\n  - **Balancing**: If the graph has characteristics that suggest an uneven distribution, consider balancing early.\n    - Execution Step: Use `balanced_cut_c0e6` to ensure an initial balanced partition if needed.\n\n#### Construction Phase\n- **Objective**: Build upon the initial solution by progressively refining the partition.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Greedy**: Continue improving cut value with a focus on immediate gains.\n    - Execution Step: Apply `highest_delta_node_b31b` to iteratively add nodes that provide the greatest immediate improvement.\n  - **Balancing**: Maintain equilibrium between sets while constructing the solution.\n    - Execution Step: Use `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` with appropriate parameters to incorporate future impact considerations.\n\n#### Improvement Phase\n- **Objective**: Enhance the quality of the solution by exploring the solution space more deeply.\n- **Suggested Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Swap-based**: Focus on local improvements through swaps to escape local optima.\n    - Execution Step: Start with `greedy_swap_5bb5` for single-node swaps, and transition to `multi_swap_2_dbfe` for more complex swaps if needed.\n  - **Probabilistic**: Introduce randomness to explore more of the solution space.\n    - Execution Step: Apply `simulated_annealing_ed14` to probabilistically accept swaps that may initially worsen the solution but could lead to better configurations.\n\n#### Evaluation and Iteration Phase\n- **Objective**: Continuously assess the effectiveness of applied heuristics and adaptively change strategies.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  - Evaluate the performance of the solution after each heuristic application using metrics like cut weight, balance between sets, and convergence rate.\n  - Switch categories or heuristics if improvements stagnate or regress. For instance, if greedy methods plateau, try swap-based or probabilistic approaches.\n  - Consider hybrid approaches by combining elements of different categories (e.g., alternating between `highest_delta_node_b31b` and `greedy_swap_5bb5`).\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Adaptability**: Remain flexible in switching between heuristics based on the observed performance.\n- **Balance**: Ensure that both immediate and long-term impacts are considered, particularly for larger graphs where local optima are prevalent.\n- **Diversity**: Use a diverse set of heuristics to cover different aspects of the problem, reducing the risk of getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\nThis guide is intended to serve as a framework, allowing for iterative experimentation and adaptation based on the specific characteristics of the problem instance and results observed during the solution process."

This will quickly provide an initial partition by focusing on immediate gains in cut value. The greedy category can help establish a baseline solution, which we can later improve using other heuristic categories.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the initial application of the greedy heuristic (highest_delta_edge_9f66) resulted in minimal changes to the solution, it would be beneficial to continue with the greedy category to further develop the solution. Given the current state, where only one node has been selected and no significant cut value has been achieved, continuing with a greedy heuristic will allow for the rapid addition of nodes to the solution, establishing a more substantial baseline. This will set the stage for future improvements using other heuristic categories.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balancing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has begun to take shape with nodes in both sets, but the cut value is still low, and the imbalance ratio is minimal. Given the low selected_nodes_ratio and unselected_nodes_ratio, it may be beneficial to switch to a balancing heuristic. This approach will focus on maintaining equilibrium between the sets while potentially increasing the cut value by considering future impacts. This can help avoid potential local optima that a purely greedy approach might lead to, allowing for a more robust development of the solution.\nSelected Node: 2->2\nCut Value: 1.0->1.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nHeuristic Category: swap_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where the cut value is low and the imbalance ratio is minimal, it might be beneficial to explore swap-based heuristics. This category can help improve the solution by focusing on local improvements through swaps, which can increase the cut value by exploring different configurations of the current partition. Swap-based heuristics are effective in potentially escaping local optima and can complement the previous balancing strategy by refining the solution further.\nSelected Node: 2->2\nCut Value: 1.0->1.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nHeuristic Category: probabilistic\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the cut value has not improved significantly after applying both greedy and swap-based heuristics, and considering the minimal imbalance ratio and high number of unselected nodes, it might be beneficial to explore a probabilistic heuristic like simulated annealing. This can help escape potential local optima by accepting suboptimal moves with a decreasing probability, possibly leading to a better configuration over time.\nSelected Node: 2->2\nCut Value: 1.0->1.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balancing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has a low cut value and a high number of unselected nodes, indicating that the solution is still in an early stage of development. While the probabilistic approach was explored to escape local optima, the current imbalance ratio and boundary node ratio suggest an opportunity to improve the balance between the sets while potentially increasing the cut value. Switching to a balancing heuristic can help maintain equilibrium and enhance the solution by considering both immediate and future impacts, especially given the high number of unselected nodes.\nSelected Node: 2->3\nCut Value: 1.0->1.0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: highest_weight_edge_ca02\nHeuristic Category: greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state where the cut value and imbalance ratio remain low, and with a high number of unselected nodes, it may be beneficial to return to a greedy approach. Greedy heuristics can help quickly add nodes that maximize immediate gains in the cut value. This approach can establish a more substantial baseline, allowing subsequent heuristics to work with a more developed solution. The use of a greedy heuristic will help transition the solution from its initial stages to a more refined state.\nSelected Node: 3->4\nCut Value: 1.0->3.0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balancing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, where both the cut value and imbalance ratio remain low and the number of unselected nodes is still high, it may be beneficial to switch to a balancing heuristic. This category can help maintain equilibrium between the sets while potentially increasing the cut value by considering future impacts. The balancing approach can also help avoid potential local optima and provide a more robust development of the solution, especially with the high number of unselected nodes.\nSelected Node: 4->5\nCut Value: 3.0->3.0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe\nHeuristic Category: swap_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where the cut value has not improved significantly after multiple balancing attempts and the imbalance ratio is minimal, it would be beneficial to explore swap-based heuristics. This category can help increase the cut value by focusing on local improvements through swaps, potentially escaping local optima and allowing for exploration of different configurations of the current partition. With a high number of unselected nodes, swap-based strategies can refine the existing solution more effectively.\nSelected Node: 5->5\nCut Value: 3.0->3.0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nHeuristic Category: probabilistic\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state where the cut value remains low and the imbalance ratio is minimal, it may be beneficial to switch to a probabilistic approach. This category, such as simulated annealing, can help explore the solution space more broadly, potentially escaping local optima by accepting suboptimal moves with a decreasing probability. With a high number of unselected nodes, a probabilistic approach might lead to a more diverse exploration of possible configurations and improvements in the cut value.\nSelected Node: 5->5\nCut Value: 3.0->3.0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state, where the cut value remains low and the imbalance ratio is minimal, it is beneficial to revisit a greedy approach. The high number of unselected nodes indicates that there is still room to rapidly develop the solution by focusing on immediate gains in cut value. A greedy heuristic can help establish a more substantial baseline solution, from which other heuristic categories can then further refine and improve the partitioning.\nSelected Node: 5->6\nCut Value: 3.0->5.0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balancing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where the cut value has shown some improvement but remains low, and the imbalance ratio is minimal, switching to a balancing heuristic could be beneficial. This category can help maintain equilibrium between sets while considering future impacts, potentially leading to further improvements in the cut value. With a high number of unselected nodes, a balancing approach can help develop the solution more robustly and avoid potential local optima that the greedy method may lead to.\nSelected Node: 6->7\nCut Value: 5.0->6.0\n---Round 12---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution shows a low cut value and minimal imbalance, with a high number of unselected nodes (793 out of 800). This indicates significant room for rapid development of the solution. A greedy approach can effectively add nodes to the partition, focusing on immediate gains in cut value. By quickly expanding the solution, we can establish a more substantial baseline, which can be further refined with other heuristics. This aligns with the iterative approach of alternating heuristic categories to explore different solution aspects.\nSelected Node: 7->8\nCut Value: 6.0->9.0\n---Round 13---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balancing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state, where the cut value has shown some improvement but remains relatively low and the imbalance ratio is minimal, switching to a balancing heuristic could be beneficial. This category can help maintain equilibrium between sets while considering future impacts, potentially leading to further improvements in the cut value. With a high number of unselected nodes, a balancing approach can help develop the solution more robustly and avoid potential local optima that the greedy method may lead to. This aligns with the iterative approach of alternating heuristic categories to explore different solution aspects.\nSelected Node: 8->9\nCut Value: 9.0->10.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 256,481,3,121,797\nset_b: 0,146,312,47\n\nset_a_count:5\nset_b_count:4\nselected_nodes:{256, 481, 0, 3, 47, 146, 312, 121, 797}\nselected_num:9\nunselected_num:791\ncurrent_cut_value:10.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.00125\ncut_value:10.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:1.1111111111111112\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.01125\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.98875\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0.05859375\nboundary_node_ratio:0.01125\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: balanced_cut_c0e6(balancing).
