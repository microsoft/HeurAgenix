The randomness helps in diversifying the initial solutions and sets a foundation for more targeted heuristics in subsequent steps. The large number of steps (100) is chosen to ensure sufficient exploration at the start.\nDelta of Selected Node: 100\nDelta of Cut Value: 148.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The current state shows a relatively balanced partition with a cut value of 148.0 and an imbalance ratio of 0.0125. Simulated Annealing is suitable for exploring global solution spaces and escaping local optima, which can be beneficial given the current state with a high number of unselected nodes (700). Running it for 200 steps allows for sufficient exploration and exploitation, leveraging its probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to potentially enhance the cut value further.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: -4.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: Given the current imbalance ratio of 0.0025 and a relatively low cut value of 144.0, the Greedy Swap heuristic can help incrementally improve the solution by evaluating potential swaps between sets A and B. Running it for 200 steps allows for thorough exploration of possible node swaps, which may lead to a higher cut value as it focuses on immediate improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 58.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The Greedy Swap heuristic showed a significant improvement in the last round with a delta of 58.0 in cut value. Given the current balance between sets and the cut value, continuing with this heuristic can further exploit immediate swap opportunities to enhance the solution. Running it for another 200 steps will allow for thorough exploration of potential node swaps, leveraging its strength in making incremental improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The previous application of the Greedy Swap heuristic resulted in a significant improvement in the cut value, indicating its effectiveness in the current state. Given the balanced partition and zero change in the last round, continuing with this heuristic for another 200 steps could further explore potential swaps and enhance the cut value by capitalizing on its strength in making incremental improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, the Greedy Swap heuristic has previously demonstrated a significant improvement in the cut value. Although recent rounds have shown no change, the balanced partition and the potential for further optimization suggest that continuing with this heuristic may still yield benefits. Running for another 200 steps will allow for comprehensive exploration of possible swaps, leveraging its strength in making incremental improvements and possibly finding new opportunities for optimization.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The current solution shows no improvement with the Greedy Swap heuristic over the last few rounds, indicating potential stagnation in local optima. Simulated Annealing is suitable for escaping these local optima by exploring a wider solution space and probabilistically accepting worse solutions initially. Running it for 200 steps will allow for sufficient exploration and the possibility of finding a better solution.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The current solution has shown stagnation with Simulated Annealing in recent rounds, and the partition is quite balanced. The Most Weight Neighbors heuristic could be beneficial here due to its focus on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value. This heuristic also considers periodic swaps, which could help escape any local optima. A larger number of steps (200) will allow for extensive exploration and potential improvement of the cut value.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 1392.0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic showed a significant improvement in the previous round with a substantial increase in both the selected nodes and the cut value. Given the current state of the solution, continuing with this heuristic is advisable to further leverage its ability to consider both immediate and future impacts on the cut value. Additionally, its periodic swaps may help in escaping local optima and enhancing the solution. Running for 200 steps should provide ample opportunity to explore these benefits further.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 2283.0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has shown substantial improvements in the previous two rounds, significantly increasing both the number of selected nodes and the cut value. Given its ability to assess immediate and future impacts on the cut value, as well as its periodic swap operations that help escape local optima, it is advisable to continue with this heuristic. Running it for 200 steps should provide ample opportunity to further leverage its strengths and potentially enhance the solution even more.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 2974.0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has demonstrated substantial improvements in the cut value over the past three rounds, indicating its effectiveness in the current state. Given its focus on both immediate and future impacts, as well as its ability to perform periodic swaps, it is advisable to continue with this heuristic. Running it for another 200 steps will allow for further exploration of potential improvements and leveraging its strengths in enhancing the solution.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 3347.0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has consistently shown substantial improvements in the cut value over the last few rounds. Given the current state with a high boundary node ratio and a balanced partition, this heuristic's ability to consider immediate and future impacts, along with periodic swaps, suggests it is well-suited to further enhance the solution. Continuing with 200 steps will allow for comprehensive exploration of its strengths and potential improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 60\nDelta of Cut Value: 1252.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_weight_neighbors_d31b. How does most_weight_neighbors_d31b perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important.
