I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing scenarios for heuristic algorithms in the context of the Max Cut problem involves understanding the characteristics of the graph and the specific goals of each heuristic. Here's an analysis of where each heuristic might be most applicable, along with quantifiable scenarios:

1. **Balanced Cut (balanced_cut_c0e6)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when the goal is to maintain balanced partitions while maximizing the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where node weights are relatively uniform, and a balanced partition leads to better solutions.

2. **Highest Weight Edge (highest_weight_edge_ca02)**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when edges have significantly varying weights, and selecting edges with the highest weight can lead to a better cut.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for graphs with a few high-weight edges that, when cut, can significantly increase the cut value.

3. **Most Weight Neighbors (most_weight_neighbors_d31b)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for graphs where the local neighborhood of a node can have a substantial impact on the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in dense graphs where local configurations can be leveraged to improve the cut.

4. **Greedy Swap (greedy_swap_5bb5)**:
   - **Scenario**: Works well in scenarios where small, incremental improvements are desired.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with multiple low-weight edges, where swapping can incrementally improve the solution without significant computational overhead.

5. **Highest Delta Edge (highest_delta_edge_9f66)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when adding specific edges can lead to large improvements in cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for sparse graphs where specific edges have a disproportionate impact on the cut.

6. **Highest Delta Node (highest_delta_node_b31b)**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when individual node placement can significantly affect the cut.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for graphs where node connectivity varies greatly, and strategic node placement is critical.

7. **Multi Swap 2 (multi_swap_2_dbfe)**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for graphs where complex swaps can lead to significant improvements and computational resources allow for exhaustive evaluation.
   - **Quantification**: Ideal for medium-sized graphs where pairwise swaps can be evaluated efficiently to improve the cut.

8. **Random (random_5c59)**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for large, complex graphs where deterministic heuristics may get stuck in local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in exploratory phases or when diversity in solutions is needed.

9. **Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing_ed14)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for escaping local optima in complex, rugged solution landscapes.
   - **Quantification**: Best for large graphs where global exploration is necessary, and accepting temporary worse solutions can lead to better long-term outcomes.

These scenarios and quantifications can guide the selection of heuristics based on the specific characteristics of the graph and the computational resources available.

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: random_5c59
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Given that the initial state has no nodes assigned to sets A or B and all nodes are unselected, starting with the Random heuristic is a reasonable choice to quickly explore potential configurations. The randomness helps in diversifying the initial solutions and sets a foundation for more targeted heuristics in subsequent steps. The large number of steps (100) is chosen to ensure sufficient exploration at the start.
Delta of Selected Node: 100
Delta of Cut Value: 148.0
---Round 1---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The current state shows a relatively balanced partition with a cut value of 148.0 and an imbalance ratio of 0.0125. Simulated Annealing is suitable for exploring global solution spaces and escaping local optima, which can be beneficial given the current state with a high number of unselected nodes (700). Running it for 200 steps allows for sufficient exploration and exploitation, leveraging its probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to potentially enhance the cut value further.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: -4.0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: Given the current imbalance ratio of 0.0025 and a relatively low cut value of 144.0, the Greedy Swap heuristic can help incrementally improve the solution by evaluating potential swaps between sets A and B. Running it for 200 steps allows for thorough exploration of possible node swaps, which may lead to a higher cut value as it focuses on immediate improvements.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 58.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_swap_5bb5. How does greedy_swap_5bb5 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Since a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
running steps: 200
explanation: The Greedy Swap heuristic showed a significant improvement in the last round with a delta of 58.0 in cut value. Given the current balance between sets and the cut value, continuing with this heuristic can further exploit immediate swap opportunities to enhance the solution. Running it for another 200 steps will allow for thorough exploration of potential node swaps, leveraging its strength in making incremental improvements.
