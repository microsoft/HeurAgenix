Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.

The uniform edge weights and low edge density align well with this heuristic's focus.\n\nHere is my recommendation:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nrunning steps: 10\nexplanation: The `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` heuristic has consistently provided improvements in cut value by effectively leveraging local neighborhood structures. Given the uniform edge weights and low edge density, it aligns well with the graph's characteristics. While there are signs of diminishing returns, continuing with 10 more steps allows for a cautious evaluation of further incremental gains while maintaining balance between the sets, without overcommitting.\n***"
