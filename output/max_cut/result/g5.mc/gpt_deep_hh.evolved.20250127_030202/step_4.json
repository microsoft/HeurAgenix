Here's a suggested framework for alternating between different heuristics:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution\n\n#### 1. **Initialization Phase**\n- **Objective:** Quickly construct an initial feasible solution.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Greedy_Approach:** Start with heuristics like `highest_delta_node_b31b` to quickly build a solution by selecting nodes that maximize the immediate cut value.\n  - **Edge-Based_Selection:** Use `highest_weight_edge_ca02` to initially place nodes based on edge weights, ensuring a strong starting point.\n- **Execution Steps:**\n  - Run each construction heuristic briefly to generate an initial solution.\n  - Evaluate the initial solution's cut value and balance between sets A and B.\n\n#### 2. **Exploration Phase**\n- **Objective:** Diversify the solution space and avoid local optima.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Simulated_Annealing:** Apply `simulated_annealing_ed14` to allow exploration of the solution space by accepting suboptimal solutions with a decreasing probability.\n  - **High_Impact_Node_Selection:** Implement `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to consider future impacts and immediate gains, diversifying node selection.\n- **Execution Steps:**\n  - Run simulated annealing for a set number of iterations or until a plateau is reached.\n  - Periodically apply high-impact node selection heuristics to guide exploration.\n\n#### 3. **Improvement Phase**\n- **Objective:** Enhance solution quality by refining the partition.\n- **Heuristic Categories:**\n  - **Periodic_Swap_Enhancements:** Use `greedy_swap_5bb5` and `multi_swap_2_dbfe` to iteratively improve the cut by swapping nodes.\n  - **Future_Impact_Consideration:** Apply `balanced_cut_c0e6` to ensure partitions are balanced and consider long-term improvements.\n- **Execution Steps:**\n  - Evaluate and perform swaps that increase the cut value.\n  - Use future impact consideration to guide swaps and maintain partition balance.\n\n#### 4. **Evaluation Phase**\n- **Objective:** Assess heuristic performance and adapt strategy.\n- **Execution Steps:**\n  - Compare the current solution's cut value to previous iterations.\n  - If the current heuristic is ineffective, switch to a different category.\n  - Record performance metrics for each heuristic to inform future decisions.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Cycle Through Phases:** Alternate between the exploration and improvement phases to iteratively enhance the solution.\n- **Adapt and Refine:** Continuously adapt the strategy based on performance evaluation, experimenting with different categories and heuristics as needed.\n- **Avoid Over-reliance:** Limit the duration of any single heuristic to prevent stagnation, ensuring diverse algorithmic exploration.\n\nThis framework serves as a flexible guide, allowing you to adapt and refine your approach based on the specific characteristics of the MaxCut problem instance and the performance of the heuristics applied."

This category will allow us to rapidly construct an initial partition by selecting nodes that provide immediate gains in the cut value, setting a foundation for further refinement.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: High_Impact_Node_Selection\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the initial solution has only one node in set B and no edges contributing to the cut value, shifting to the High_Impact_Node_Selection category can help strategically add nodes that maximize the cut value. This approach will focus on selecting nodes with the highest potential impact, which is crucial at this stage to establish a stronger baseline for further optimization.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: highest_weight_edge_ca02\nHeuristic Category: High_Impact_Node_Selection\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the early stage of solution development, where only two nodes have been selected and the cut value is still minimal, it is beneficial to continue with the High_Impact_Node_Selection category. This approach will help identify and add nodes that can significantly increase the cut value. As the solution is still in its formative phase, strategically adding high-impact nodes will strengthen the baseline and prepare it for future refinement with more complex heuristics.\nSelected Node: 2->3\nCut Value: 1.0->2.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: Future_Impact_Consideration\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  0.00125), it is beneficial to shift to the Future_Impact_Consideration category.
