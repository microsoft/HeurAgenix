Starting with a random insertion heuristic can help quickly generate an initial solution by distributing nodes into the two sets. Given the large number of unselected nodes, running 200 steps provides a substantial foundation for further refinement with more targeted heuristics.\nDelta of Selected Node: 200\nDelta of Cut Value: -1.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: Given the current cut value is negative and the edge weights vary significantly with both positive and negative values, applying simulated annealing can help explore the solution space more thoroughly. It can potentially escape local optima and improve the cut value by probabilistically accepting worse solutions initially. Running 100 steps allows for substantial exploration while keeping computation manageable.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 24.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The simulated annealing heuristic showed significant improvement in the previous round, increasing the cut value by 24.0. Given the complexity of the solution space and the presence of diverse edge weights, continuing with simulated annealing for an extended run of 200 steps will allow for further exploration and potential improvement of the cut value. This approach is designed to leverage the probabilistic nature of the heuristic to escape potential local optima and refine the solution further.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 22.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The previous rounds of simulated annealing have shown consistent improvement in the cut value, indicating that this heuristic is effective in exploring the solution space and escaping local optima in the current problem context. Given the complexity and variance in edge weights, continuing with another 200 steps of simulated annealing can further exploit its probabilistic nature to enhance the solution quality. The current state data suggests that there is still room for improvement in the cut value, making this approach a prudent choice.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: simulated_annealing_ed14. How does simulated_annealing_ed14 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
