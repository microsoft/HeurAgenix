I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Each heuristic for the Max Cut problem may have scenarios where it performs better based on the characteristics of the graph and the problem constraints. Here's an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Balanced Cut Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the goal is to maintain balanced partitions of vertices while optimizing the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where partition balance is crucial, such as bipartite graphs or when constraints on partition sizes are present.

2. **Highest Weight Edge Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for graphs where edges have significantly varying weights, and maximizing the edge weight in the cut is prioritized.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for weighted graphs with a few high-weight edges.

3. **Most Weight Neighbors Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when future impact and immediate gains are both critical, and periodic re-evaluation through swaps can lead to better solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Works well in graphs with clusters, where nodes are connected to many other nodes with varying weights.

4. **Greedy Swap Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for graphs where local improvements can lead to a near-optimal solution, and swaps can quickly increase the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for dense graphs where many edges connect nodes across the partitions.

5. **Highest Delta Edge Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Targets scenarios where selecting an edge can have a significant impact on the cut weight, especially in sparse graphs.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for sparse graphs where each edge inclusion significantly alters the cut value.

6. **Highest Delta Node Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for situations where adding individual nodes can drastically change the cut value, often in graphs with key nodes having high connectivity.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in graphs with a few high-degree nodes that dominate the cut weight.

7. **Multi Swap Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for exploring more complex swap operations that can leverage simultaneous changes for larger improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for graphs where single swaps are insufficient, and multiple node interactions need consideration.

8. **Random Node Insertion Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for initial solution generation or when randomness can help escape local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in very large or complex graphs where deterministic methods struggle to explore the solution space.

9. **Simulated Annealing Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when escaping local optima is necessary, and a probabilistic approach can find better solutions over time.
   - **Quantification**: Best for large-scale graphs with complex landscapes where local optima are prevalent.

In practice, the choice of heuristic may depend on additional factors such as computational resources, time constraints, and specific problem requirements. Testing and benchmarking on representative instances of the problem can provide further insights into their applicability.
