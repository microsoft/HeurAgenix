I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Each heuristic for the Max Cut problem may have scenarios where it performs better based on the characteristics of the graph and the problem constraints. Here's an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Balanced Cut Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the goal is to maintain balanced partitions of vertices while optimizing the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where partition balance is crucial, such as bipartite graphs or when constraints on partition sizes are present.

2. **Highest Weight Edge Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for graphs where edges have significantly varying weights, and maximizing the edge weight in the cut is prioritized.
   - **Quantification**: Effective for weighted graphs with a few high-weight edges.

3. **Most Weight Neighbors Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when future impact and immediate gains are both critical, and periodic re-evaluation through swaps can lead to better solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Works well in graphs with clusters, where nodes are connected to many other nodes with varying weights.

4. **Greedy Swap Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for graphs where local improvements can lead to a near-optimal solution, and swaps can quickly increase the cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for dense graphs where many edges connect nodes across the partitions.

5. **Highest Delta Edge Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Targets scenarios where selecting an edge can have a significant impact on the cut weight, especially in sparse graphs.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for sparse graphs where each edge inclusion significantly alters the cut value.

6. **Highest Delta Node Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for situations where adding individual nodes can drastically change the cut value, often in graphs with key nodes having high connectivity.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in graphs with a few high-degree nodes that dominate the cut weight.

7. **Multi Swap Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for exploring more complex swap operations that can leverage simultaneous changes for larger improvements.
   - **Quantification**: Suitable for graphs where single swaps are insufficient, and multiple node interactions need consideration.

8. **Random Node Insertion Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful for initial solution generation or when randomness can help escape local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in very large or complex graphs where deterministic methods struggle to explore the solution space.

9. **Simulated Annealing Heuristic**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when escaping local optima is necessary, and a probabilistic approach can find better solutions over time.
   - **Quantification**: Best for large-scale graphs with complex landscapes where local optima are prevalent.

In practice, the choice of heuristic may depend on additional factors such as computational resources, time constraints, and specific problem requirements. Testing and benchmarking on representative instances of the problem can provide further insights into their applicability.

Before this discuss, we have already 5 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: random_5c59
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The initial state shows that no nodes are currently selected, and the partitions are empty. Starting with a random insertion heuristic can help quickly generate an initial solution by distributing nodes into the two sets. Given the large number of unselected nodes, running 200 steps provides a substantial foundation for further refinement with more targeted heuristics.
Delta of Selected Node: 200
Delta of Cut Value: -1.0
---Round 1---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Given the current cut value is negative and the edge weights vary significantly with both positive and negative values, applying simulated annealing can help explore the solution space more thoroughly. It can potentially escape local optima and improve the cut value by probabilistically accepting worse solutions initially. Running 100 steps allows for substantial exploration while keeping computation manageable.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 24.0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The simulated annealing heuristic showed significant improvement in the previous round, increasing the cut value by 24.0. Given the complexity of the solution space and the presence of diverse edge weights, continuing with simulated annealing for an extended run of 200 steps will allow for further exploration and potential improvement of the cut value. This approach is designed to leverage the probabilistic nature of the heuristic to escape potential local optima and refine the solution further.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 22.0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The previous rounds of simulated annealing have shown consistent improvement in the cut value, indicating that this heuristic is effective in exploring the solution space and escaping local optima in the current problem context. Given the complexity and variance in edge weights, continuing with another 200 steps of simulated annealing can further exploit its probabilistic nature to enhance the solution quality. The current state data suggests that there is still room for improvement in the cut value, making this approach a prudent choice.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 0.0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The simulated annealing heuristic has demonstrated effectiveness in previous rounds by significantly improving the cut value, especially when faced with complex solution spaces and diverse edge weights. Despite no improvement in the last round, the probabilistic nature of simulated annealing suggests there may still be potential to escape local optima and further refine the solution. Continuing with 200 steps leverages the heuristic's strength in exploring and potentially enhancing the solution further.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 0.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: simulated_annealing_ed14. How does simulated_annealing_ed14 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Since a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5  
running steps: 200  
explanation: Simulated annealing has plateaued, suggesting local optima. The greedy swap heuristic can explore swaps that improve the cut value by evaluating possible node swaps between sets A and B. Given the current balance between sets and the potential for swaps to yield immediate improvements in the cut value, running 200 steps will allow for a thorough evaluation of swap opportunities. This could exploit the current solution's structure to find better configurations.
