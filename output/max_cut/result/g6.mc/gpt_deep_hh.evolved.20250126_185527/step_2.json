                "text": "To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps, we can consider both the construction and improvement phases of solving the MaxCut problem. Given the characteristics of your problem and dataset, a diverse approach that balances construction and refinement is ideal. Here's a framework to guide your decision-making:\n\n### Construction Phase\nDuring this phase, the objective is to quickly build an initial solution that is reasonably good but not necessarily optimal. The focus should be on heuristics that can rapidly partition the graph with some logic that considers cut value potential.\n\n1. **Node-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **Use Case:** Begin with node-based heuristics such as `highest_delta_node_b31b` to rapidly construct a partition by evaluating the potential increase in cut value when adding nodes to either set.\n   - **Execution Steps:** \n     - Run the heuristic for a fixed number of nodes or until diminishing returns are observed in terms of cut value increase.\n     - Assess the initial cut value and the balance between the two sets.\n\n2. **Edge-Based Heuristics:**\n   - **Use Case:** If nodes have been placed with significant imbalances, use edge-based heuristics like `highest_weight_edge_ca02` to refine the placement by focusing on high-impact edges.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Evaluate unselected edges and place nodes connected by high-weight edges into opposite sets.\n     - Run until the initial solution appears to stabilize or a predefined iteration limit is reached.\n\n### Improvement Phase\nAfter constructing an initial solution, the focus shifts to refining it through local search and strategic swaps.\n\n1. **Local Search Heuristics:**\n   - **Use Case:** Apply local search techniques such as `greedy_swap_5bb5` to explore beneficial swaps that improve the cut value.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Perform single-node swaps iteratively and evaluate the impact on cut value.\n     - If beneficial swaps are found, apply them; if not, move to the next phase.\n\n2. **Balance and Swap Heuristics:**\n   - **Use Case:** Utilize balanced and swap heuristics like `balanced_cut_c0e6` to ensure the partition remains balanced and make strategic swaps.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Maintain balance between set sizes while performing swaps.\n     - Periodically check the partition's balance and adjust as needed.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Heuristics:**\n   - **Use Case:** Introduce probabilistic heuristics such as `simulated_annealing_ed14` to escape local optima and explore diverse solutions.\n   - **Execution Steps:**\n     - Implement the heuristic with a cooling schedule and acceptance probability for worse solutions.\n     - Allow for exploration of less optimal solutions initially, gradually reducing this exploration over time.\n\n### Iteration and Evaluation\n- **Iterative Testing:** Alternate between different heuristic categories, applying them for a set number of iterations or until their improvement plateaus.\n- **Evaluation:** After each heuristic application, evaluate the cut value and other metrics like balance and computational efficiency.\n- **Adaptation:** Based on performance, adapt the heuristic selection by either repeating effective ones or introducing new categories.\n\n### Final Considerations\n- **Flexibility:** Be flexible in switching between heuristics; if one seems ineffective, move to another.\n- **Balance:** Ensure a balance between exploration (probabilistic) and exploitation (local search and swaps).\n- **Performance Metrics:** Define performance metrics to assess heuristic effectiveness, including cut value improvement, runtime, and partition balance.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically alternate between different heuristic categories and adapt your approach based on the observed performance, optimizing the solution of the MaxCut problem iteratively."

Node-based heuristics, like inserting nodes into sets based on potential cut value increase, are suitable for quickly building an initial solution. This approach will help transition from the unselected state to a more defined partition, setting the stage for further improvement.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: node_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution is still in its early stages, with only one node selected and a cut value of zero. Continuing with a node-based heuristic like `highest_delta_node_b31b` can help further develop the initial partition by adding nodes that maximize the potential increase in cut value. This approach will continue to build a foundational solution before transitioning to more complex heuristics for refinement.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 15\nset_b: 0\n\nset_a_count:1\nset_b_count:1\nselected_nodes:{0, 15}\nselected_num:2\nunselected_num:798\ncurrent_cut_value:1.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.0\ncut_value:1.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:0.5\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.0025\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.9975\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0\nboundary_node_ratio:0.0025\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: highest_delta_node_b31b(node_based).
