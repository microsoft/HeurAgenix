I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic involves understanding the specific characteristics of the MaxCut problem instances where they might perform best. Here are some potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Balanced Cut (balanced_cut_c0e6):** 
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Useful when the problem requires balanced partitions with similar sizes, such as in load balancing or network partitioning applications.
   - **Quantification:** Look for graphs where balancing the number of nodes in each set is crucial, especially when each node has a similar degree.

2. **Highest Weight Edge (highest_weight_edge_ca02):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective for sparse graphs or instances where high-weight edges dominate, focusing on maximizing immediate cut value gains.
   - **Quantification:** Scenarios where edge weights vary significantly, and capturing high-weight edges early can provide a good starting solution.

3. **Most Weight Neighbors (most_weight_neighbors_d31b):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Suitable for dense graphs where node connectivity is high, and considering future impacts is essential for solution quality.
   - **Quantification:** Graphs with high average node degree or where neighbor impacts have a significant cumulative effect on the solution.

4. **Greedy Swap (greedy_swap_5bb5):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective when the initial solution is close to optimal, and fine-tuning through local improvements can yield substantial benefits.
   - **Quantification:** Instances where small, incremental improvements can lead to significant overall gains, often in well-connected but balanced graphs.

5. **Highest Delta Edge (highest_delta_edge_9f66):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Particularly useful in scenarios where adding individual edges significantly alters the solution, such as in graphs with a few high-impact edges.
   - **Quantification:** Graphs with a mix of low and high-weight edges where strategic edge additions can pivot the solution quality.

6. **Highest Delta Node (highest_delta_node_b31b):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Similar to highest delta edge but focused on nodes, applicable in scenarios where node placement drastically changes cut value.
   - **Quantification:** Graphs with nodes connected to many high-weight edges, where node placement is critical.

7. **Multi Swap 2 (multi_swap_2_dbfe):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective in situations where complex interactions between pairs of nodes need to be considered, often in tightly interconnected subgraphs.
   - **Quantification:** Dense subgraphs or instances where simple swaps are insufficient due to intricate node dependencies.

8. **Random (random_5c59):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Useful as a baseline or when exploring the solution space without preconceived biases, particularly in very large or uniform graphs.
   - **Quantification:** Large graphs where uniformity or symmetry makes deterministic heuristics less effective.

9. **Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing_ed14):**
   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Suitable for escaping local optima in complex landscapes, particularly in large, irregular graphs with many local optima.
   - **Quantification:** Graphs with diverse structures where escaping local optima is crucial for finding near-optimal solutions.

These scenarios provide a guideline for selecting appropriate heuristics based on the characteristics of the MaxCut problem instance being addressed.

Before this discuss, we have already 9 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Given the initial state data with no nodes selected and equal weights, starting with a balanced cut approach is suitable. It aims to create well-balanced partitions, which is crucial in the early stages of solution construction. This heuristic will help establish a strong foundation, considering the moderate edge density and uniform edge weights.
Delta of Selected Node: 82
Delta of Cut Value: 230.0
---Round 1---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: With the current imbalance ratio being very low and the edge weights being uniform, focusing on both immediate and potential future impacts on the cut value is essential. The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic will consider these factors while periodically evaluating swaps, which can help refine the solution by leveraging the high connectivity indicated by the average node degree.
Delta of Selected Node: 80
Delta of Cut Value: 519.0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: Given the high delta in cut value from the previous application of most_weight_neighbors_d31b and the need to further refine the solution due to the high connectivity and low edge weight variance, continuing with this heuristic is advisable. Running for 200 steps allows for significant exploration and potential improvement, leveraging both immediate and future impact considerations, as well as periodic swaps.
Delta of Selected Node: 160
Delta of Cut Value: 1719.0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has shown significant improvements in the cut value in the previous rounds, especially given the high connectivity and low edge weight variance. Continuing with 200 more steps allows for further refinement of the solution by leveraging both immediate and future impacts, along with periodic swaps to optimize the partition. The current state data indicates that there is still room for improvement, particularly given the imbalance ratio and the potential to select more nodes to maximize the cut value.
Delta of Selected Node: 160
Delta of Cut Value: 2535.0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 300
Explain: The previous rounds with the most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic have demonstrated substantial improvements in the cut value. Given the high connectivity and uniform edge weights, continuing with this heuristic for 300 steps could lead to further optimization by leveraging both immediate and future impacts on the cut value, as well as periodic swaps. This approach aligns with the goal of refining the solution further, considering the current state data and the potential for additional enhancements.
Delta of Selected Node: 240
Delta of Cut Value: 4798.0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 300
Explain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has consistently shown significant improvements in cut value in previous rounds. Given the high connectivity and uniform edge weights, continuing with this heuristic for another 300 steps can leverage both immediate and future impacts on the cut value, as well as periodic swaps, to further refine the solution. The remaining unselected nodes and the current imbalance ratio suggest there is still room for optimization.
Delta of Selected Node: 78
Delta of Cut Value: 1642.0
---Round 6---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The previous rounds have demonstrated significant improvements using the most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic, particularly given the high connectivity and uniform edge weights of the graph. Continuing with 200 more steps allows for further optimization by leveraging both immediate and future impacts on the cut value, along with periodic swaps. Despite the current high cut value, the small imbalance ratio and connectivity suggest there is still room for enhancing the solution, especially in refining node placements for maximum cut value.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 0.0
---Round 7---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has reached a point of diminishing returns, with no improvement in the last round. Given the current state with all nodes selected and a very low imbalance ratio, a heuristic focusing on local improvements through swaps, like greedy_swap_5bb5, is appropriate. This heuristic can fine-tune the partition by evaluating potential swaps that maximize the cut value, leveraging the uniform edge weights and high connectivity. Running for 200 steps allows for thorough exploration of swap opportunities to potentially enhance the solution further.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 6.0
---Round 8---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The previous round with the greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic showed a minor improvement in the cut value, indicating potential for further optimization through local swaps. Given that all nodes are already selected and the imbalance ratio is low, continuing with this heuristic for another 200 steps could help fine-tune the partition by exploring additional swap opportunities that maximize the cut value. This approach leverages the uniform edge weights and high connectivity, which are conducive to benefiting from targeted local adjustments.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 0.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_swap_5bb5. How does greedy_swap_5bb5 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Since a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
running steps: 300
explanation: The previous use of the greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic showed some improvement, but the last round showed no further gains. Given the low imbalance ratio and the fact that all nodes are selected, there may still be untapped potential in exploring additional swap opportunities. Increasing the number of steps to 300 could provide a more thorough exploration of the solution space, potentially identifying beneficial swaps that were missed in previous iterations, especially considering the uniform edge weights and high connectivity.
