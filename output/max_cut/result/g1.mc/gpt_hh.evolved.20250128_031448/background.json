\"current_solution\" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.\n    - \"set_a_count\" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.\n    - \"set_b_count\" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.\n    - \"selected_nodes\" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.\n    - \"selected_num\" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.\n    - \"unselected_nodes\" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.\n    -

It will not modify the origin solution.\nOther hyper-parameters in kwargs.\nThe outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.\n\nPlease consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?\nIf you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n***is_cop:yes/no***\nEnsure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.\nIf you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***."
