Here are some potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **Balanced Cut (balanced_cut_c0e6):** \n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Useful when the problem requires balanced partitions with similar sizes, such as in load balancing or network partitioning applications.\n   - **Quantification:** Look for graphs where balancing the number of nodes in each set is crucial, especially when each node has a similar degree.\n\n2. **Highest Weight Edge (highest_weight_edge_ca02):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective for sparse graphs or instances where high-weight edges dominate, focusing on maximizing immediate cut value gains.\n   - **Quantification:** Scenarios where edge weights vary significantly, and capturing high-weight edges early can provide a good starting solution.\n\n3. **Most Weight Neighbors (most_weight_neighbors_d31b):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Suitable for dense graphs where node connectivity is high, and considering future impacts is essential for solution quality.\n   - **Quantification:** Graphs with high average node degree or where neighbor impacts have a significant cumulative effect on the solution.\n\n4. **Greedy Swap (greedy_swap_5bb5):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective when the initial solution is close to optimal, and fine-tuning through local improvements can yield substantial benefits.\n   - **Quantification:** Instances where small, incremental improvements can lead to significant overall gains, often in well-connected but balanced graphs.\n\n5. **Highest Delta Edge (highest_delta_edge_9f66):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Particularly useful in scenarios where adding individual edges significantly alters the solution, such as in graphs with a few high-impact edges.\n   - **Quantification:** Graphs with a mix of low and high-weight edges where strategic edge additions can pivot the solution quality.\n\n6. **Highest Delta Node (highest_delta_node_b31b):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Similar to highest delta edge but focused on nodes, applicable in scenarios where node placement drastically changes cut value.\n   - **Quantification:** Graphs with nodes connected to many high-weight edges, where node placement is critical.\n\n7. **Multi Swap 2 (multi_swap_2_dbfe):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Effective in situations where complex interactions between pairs of nodes need to be considered, often in tightly interconnected subgraphs.\n   - **Quantification:** Dense subgraphs or instances where simple swaps are insufficient due to intricate node dependencies.\n\n8. **Random (random_5c59):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Useful as a baseline or when exploring the solution space without preconceived biases, particularly in very large or uniform graphs.\n   - **Quantification:** Large graphs where uniformity or symmetry makes deterministic heuristics less effective.\n\n9. **Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing_ed14):**\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:** Suitable for escaping local optima in complex landscapes, particularly in large, irregular graphs with many local optima.\n   - **Quantification:** Graphs with diverse structures where escaping local optima is crucial for finding near-optimal solutions.\n\nThese scenarios provide a guideline for selecting appropriate heuristics based on the characteristics of the MaxCut problem instance being addressed."

It aims to create well-balanced partitions, which is crucial in the early stages of solution construction. This heuristic will help establish a strong foundation, considering the moderate edge density and uniform edge weights.\nDelta of Selected Node: 82\nDelta of Cut Value: 230.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: With the current imbalance ratio being very low and the edge weights being uniform, focusing on both immediate and potential future impacts on the cut value is essential. The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic will consider these factors while periodically evaluating swaps, which can help refine the solution by leveraging the high connectivity indicated by the average node degree.\nDelta of Selected Node: 80\nDelta of Cut Value: 519.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: Given the high delta in cut value from the previous application of most_weight_neighbors_d31b and the need to further refine the solution due to the high connectivity and low edge weight variance, continuing with this heuristic is advisable. Running for 200 steps allows for significant exploration and potential improvement, leveraging both immediate and future impact considerations, as well as periodic swaps.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 1719.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_weight_neighbors_d31b. How does most_weight_neighbors_d31b perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important.
