Here\u2019s a breakdown of potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **balanced_cut_c0e6()**: \n   - **Scenario**: When you need a balanced partition of nodes between the two sets, perhaps due to additional constraints or preferences in the problem context. \n   - **Quantified by**: Balance measure between the sizes of the two sets, while maintaining a reasonable cut value.\n\n2. **highest_weight_edge_ca02()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, making it crucial to prioritize the heaviest edges for partitioning.\n   - **Quantified by**: The overall weight of the edges included in the cut, particularly focusing on edges with high individual weights.\n\n3. **most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor=0.5, swap_frequency=5)**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in graphs with nodes having varying degrees and weighted connections, where both immediate and future impacts are important.\n   - **Quantified by**: A combination of immediate cut value increase and potential future benefits from node placement, adjusted by the scaling factor.\n\n4. **greedy_swap_5bb5()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when you can afford to explore multiple swap possibilities and the graph's structure allows for potential gains from swaps.\n   - **Quantified by**: The net increase in cut value after each swap, with a focus on maximizing immediate gains.\n\n5. **highest_delta_edge_9f66()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for sparse graphs or those where the presence of certain edges drastically changes the cut value.\n   - **Quantified by**: The change in cut weight resulting from the addition of specific edges.\n\n6. **highest_delta_node_b31b()**:\n   - **Scenario**: When node-specific characteristics (like high connectivity) significantly influence the solution's quality.\n   - **Quantified by**: The increase in total cut weight from optimal node placement.\n\n7. **multi_swap_2_dbfe()**:\n   - **Scenario**: For graphs where the interaction between multiple nodes is crucial, and simultaneous swaps can yield better results.\n   - **Quantified by**: The combined effect of swapping pairs of nodes, maximizing the cut value through complex interactions.\n\n8. **random_5c59()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful as a baseline or for generating diverse solutions in large, complex graphs where deterministic approaches might get stuck in local optima.\n   - **Quantified by**: The diversity of solutions produced, potentially serving as a starting point for other heuristics.\n\n9. **simulated_annealing_ed14()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective for large, complex graphs where local optima are common, and a probabilistic approach is needed to explore the solution space thoroughly.\n   - **Quantified by**: The ability to escape local optima and the gradual convergence towards a high-quality solution over time.\n\nEach heuristic's applicability depends on the graph's structure, the nature of edge weights, the importance of balance between the sets, and the computational resources available.

Starting with a random heuristic allows us to quickly generate a diverse set of potential solutions. This can serve as a foundation for more sophisticated heuristics to refine the solution. Given the size of the problem (800 nodes) and the need for an initial structure, running 100 steps should provide a good basis for further development.\nDelta of Selected Node: 100\nDelta of Cut Value: 10.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: With a foundational solution established using random selection, transitioning to the `highest_delta_node_b31b` heuristic can help maximize the cut value by strategically adding nodes to sets based on their potential impact. Running for 100 steps allows for focused refinement to capitalize on the current node selection while exploring further improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 100\nDelta of Cut Value: 443.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The current solution has already achieved a significant increase in cut value using the highest_delta_node_b31b heuristic. To further refine the solution, it would be beneficial to consider both immediate and future impacts on the cut value. The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic is well-suited for this purpose, as it evaluates nodes based on their weighted connections and incorporates periodic swaps to enhance the solution. Given the potential for further optimization and the complex nature of the graph, running 200 steps should provide a thorough exploration of improvements.\nDelta of Selected Node: 160\nDelta of Cut Value: 320.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_weight_neighbors_d31b. How does most_weight_neighbors_d31b perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important.
