I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_21d5(max_iterations: int = 100) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """
    Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B
    while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: multi_swap_2_dbfe. How does multi_swap_2_dbfe perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the extensive history and performance of the heuristics used so far, as well as the current state of the solution, I will analyze the available data and provide a recommendation.

### Current Data Overview:
- **Selected Nodes:** 755
- **Unselected Nodes:** 45
- **Set A Count:** 375
- **Set B Count:** 380
- **Current Cut Value:** 1924.0
- **Last Heuristic Used:** `multi_swap_2_dbfe`

### Key Observations:
1. **High Number of Selected Nodes:** With 755 nodes already selected, the number of remaining unselected nodes is relatively low (45). This limits the scope for heuristics that rely on adding new nodes.
2. **Balanced Sets:** The node counts in sets A and B are nearly balanced, which is a positive state for further optimization.
3. **Recent Performance:** The `multi_swap_2_dbfe` heuristic has shown mixed results recently, with some rounds yielding no improvements.

### Decision-Making Criteria:
1. **Heuristic Performance:** Historically, `highest_delta_node_b31b` has shown consistent and significant improvements. However, its performance has recently plateaued and even shown negative deltas.
2. **Current State:** The low number of unselected nodes suggests focusing on fine-tuning the current sets rather than adding new nodes.
3. **Objective:** The goal is to further enhance the cut value while maintaining the balanced state.

### Recommended Heuristic and Steps:
Given the current state and recent performance, I recommend continuing with the `multi_swap_2_dbfe` heuristic for a few more steps. This heuristic considers the combined effect of multiple swaps, which could still yield improvements with the remaining unselected nodes.

### Selected Heuristic and Steps:
```markdown
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe
running steps: 15
explanation: The `multi_swap_2_dbfe` heuristic has shown potential for significant improvements by considering the combined effect of multiple swaps. Given the remaining 45 unselected nodes and the need to maximize the cut value, running it for 15 steps will allow us to further assess its effectiveness and potentially yield significant improvements. This approach will help leverage the remaining unselected nodes effectively while monitoring its performance closely.
***
```

This decision is based on the following considerations:
1. **Potential for Improvement:** The `multi_swap_2_dbfe` heuristic has shown potential for significant improvements in previous rounds.
2. **Focused Optimization:** With a limited number of unselected nodes, focusing on swaps can provide a more refined optimization.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Running the heuristic for 15 steps will provide a good sample size to evaluate its current performance and make further decisions based on the results.

Let's proceed with this heuristic and review the performance after 15 steps.
