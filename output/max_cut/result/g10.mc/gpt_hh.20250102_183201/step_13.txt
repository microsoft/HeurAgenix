I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

The MaxCut problem is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem, as it involves finding an optimal partition of vertices in a graph to maximize a specific objective (the total weight of edges between two disjoint sets). The framework you've described, including the `Solution` and `Operator` classes, as well as the standardized heuristic function signature, appears well-suited for applying heuristic algorithms to solve this problem.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_21d5(max_iterations: int = 100) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """
    Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B
    while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or
    the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

    Args): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def highest_weight_edge_eb0c(): Selects an edge with the highest weight where both nodes are unselected and adds each node to opposite sets, choosing the set that maximizes the cut value increase for each node.
def most_weight_neighbors_320c(): This heuristic selects an unselected node that has the highest sum of weights connected to it and inserts it into one of the sets (A or B) in the Solution, aiming to maximize the cut value. It stores the sorted list of unselected nodes based on the sum of weights for future use.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

### Analysis of Scenarios for Each Heuristic

Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable, along with suggestions on how to quantify these scenarios:

---

#### 1. **`balanced_cut_21d5`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for scenarios where the graph is dense or nearly balanced, and the goal is to maintain balance between the sizes of sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It is particularly effective in cases where the graph has uniform or close-to-uniform edge weights.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Node degree distribution is relatively uniform.
     - The total number of nodes is even or close to even.
     - High density of edges (e.g., density > 0.5).
   - **Limitations**: May not perform well for highly skewed graphs where some nodes have significantly higher degrees than others.

---

#### 2. **`greedy_swap_5bb5`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when the initial solution is already close to optimal, and only minor adjustments are needed to improve the cut value. It is best applied when the graph is sparse or when small, localized changes can significantly affect the cut value.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Initial solution cut value is close to the maximum cut value (e.g., within 10%).
     - Sparse graph with low edge density (e.g., density < 0.3).
     - Nodes with high degrees are already well-distributed between sets A and B.
   - **Limitations**: Computationally expensive for dense graphs due to the need to evaluate every possible swap.

---

#### 3. **`highest_delta_edge_9f66`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, and there are a few high-weight edges that dominate the cut value. It is effective in early stages of solution construction or refinement.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in edge weights (e.g., standard deviation of edge weights > 0.5 Ã mean edge weight).
     - A significant number of high-weight edges remain unselected.
   - **Limitations**: May lead to suboptimal solutions if applied in isolation, as it focuses only on edge weights without considering balance or node distribution.

---

#### 4. **`highest_delta_node_b31b`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when the graph has nodes with highly varied degrees or when selecting a single node can significantly impact the cut value. It is particularly effective for graphs with hub-and-spoke structures.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in node degrees (e.g., standard deviation of node degrees > 0.5 Ã mean degree).
     - Unselected nodes with high degrees remain in the graph.
   - **Limitations**: May neglect global balance between sets A and B, focusing solely on local improvements.

---

#### 5. **`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable to graphs where edge weights dominate the optimization problem. It works well in cases where adding specific high-weight edges early on can significantly affect the solution quality.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in edge weights (similar to `highest_delta_edge_9f66`).
     - A significant proportion of high-weight edges remain unselected.
   - **Limitations**: May lead to imbalanced solutions if the focus on edge weights ignores node distribution.

---

#### 6. **`most_weight_neighbors_320c`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in graphs where local neighborhoods (nodes and their immediate connections) dominate the graph structure. It is effective for graphs with clusters or communities, where the goal is to iteratively select nodes with high connectivity to existing sets.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Strong community structure in the graph (e.g., modularity > 0.3).
     - Nodes with high neighbor weights remain unselected.
   - **Limitations**: May get stuck in local optima if the heuristic prioritizes local improvements over global balance.

---

#### 7. **`multi_swap_2_dbfe`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable for scenarios where multiple swaps can collectively lead to a significant improvement in the cut value, even if individual swaps are not beneficial. It is particularly effective in dense graphs or graphs with complex interactions between nodes.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Dense graph with high edge density (e.g., density > 0.5).
     - Current solution is far from optimal, and single-node swaps are insufficient to improve the cut value.
   - **Limitations**: Computationally expensive, especially for large graphs with many nodes.

---

#### 8. **`random_5c59`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best applied in the early stages of solution construction or as a diversification mechanism in metaheuristics. It is effective when there is little information about the problem structure or when escaping local optima.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Early-stage optimization with no prior knowledge of the graph structure.
     - Used as part of an iterative metaheuristic (e.g., simulated annealing or genetic algorithms) to introduce randomness.
   - **Limitations**: Inefficient for fine-tuning or refinement of solutions.

---

#### 9. **`simulated_annealing_ed14`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is highly effective for escaping local optima and exploring the solution space. It is applicable to both dense and sparse graphs, especially when the problem landscape has many local optima.
   - **Quantification**:
     - The current solution is stuck in a local optimum (e.g., no improvement after several iterations of other heuristics).
     - The cut value is far from the expected maximum (e.g., < 80% of the estimated maximum cut value).
   - **Limitations**: May require careful tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., initial temperature, cooling rate) to balance exploration and exploitation.

---Round 0---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_320c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The graph is sparse (edge density = 0.06), and the edge weights have high variance (std_dev = ~1.0). At this stage, no nodes have been selected, and the imbalance ratio is 0.0. The heuristic `most_weight_neighbors_320c` can effectively construct an initial solution by iteratively selecting nodes with the highest weighted connections to maximize the cut value. Running 20 steps is appropriate given the large number of unselected nodes (800).
Delta of Selected Node: 20
Delta of Cut Value: 9.0

Heuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: At this stage, we have constructed an initial solution with a small cut value (9.0) and a very low imbalance ratio (0.005). The graph is sparse (edge density = 0.06) with high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0). Since there are still a large number of unselected nodes (780, ~97.5% of total nodes), it is ideal to focus on adding edges that maximize the increase in cut weight. The `highest_delta_edge_9f66` heuristic is well-suited for this purpose as it prioritizes high-weight edges for inclusion. Running 15 steps ensures significant progress while keeping the computation manageable.

Delta of Cut Value: 101.0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_320c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The graph is still sparse (edge density = 0.06) and has a high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0). With 750 unselected nodes remaining (~93.75% of total), it is essential to continue constructing the solution by targeting nodes with high-weighted connections. The `most_weight_neighbors_320c` heuristic is ideal for this stage to maximize the cut value incrementally while ensuring high-quality node selection. Running 15 steps balances progress and computational cost.

Delta of Cut Value: 20.0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current imbalance ratio is low (0.01375), and the graph still has a large number of unselected nodes (735). With the edge weights exhibiting high variance (std_dev = ~1.0), it is appropriate to focus on selecting individual nodes that maximize the cut value. The `highest_delta_node_b31b` heuristic is effective at this stage because it evaluates the impact of each node on the cut weight and ensures incremental construction of a high-quality solution. Running 15 steps will allow for significant progress while maintaining computational efficiency.
Delta of Selected Node: 15
Delta of Cut Value: 61.0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has achieved a significant cut value (191.0) with a low imbalance ratio (0.0125), and a substantial portion of nodes remain unselected (720, 90%). While the solution is progressing well, the graph's high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0) suggests there may still be opportunities to escape potential local optima and explore better configurations. Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing_ed14`) is a suitable choice at this stage to probabilistically accept suboptimal swaps and further improve the solution by refining the partition. Running 15 steps is appropriate given the large number of unselected nodes and the need to explore the solution space efficiently.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: -7.0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_320c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a low imbalance ratio (0.01) and a substantial number of unselected nodes (720, ~90%). Given the sparse nature of the graph (edge density = 0.06) and the high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), it is appropriate to focus on constructing the solution further by targeting nodes with high-weighted connections to maximize the cut value incrementally. The `most_weight_neighbors_320c` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it prioritizes high-quality node selection while maintaining balance between sets A and B. Running 15 steps balances progress and computational cost.
Delta of Selected Node: 15
Delta of Cut Value: 24.0
---Round 6---
Heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a low imbalance ratio (0.01125) and a substantial number of unselected nodes (705). The edge weights still exhibit high variance (std_dev ~ 1.0), and the current strategy should focus on carefully selecting individual nodes that maximize the cut value. The `highest_delta_node_b31b` heuristic is well-suited at this stage, as it evaluates the impact of adding each unselected node to either set A or B and prioritizes those that maximize the cut weight. Running 15 steps balances computational efficiency and solution refinement.
Delta of Selected Node: 15
Delta of Cut Value: 63.0
---Round 7---
Heuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has achieved a good cut value (261.0) and a low imbalance ratio (0.01). However, with 690 nodes still unselected, there is room for significant refinement. The `multi_swap_2_dbfe` heuristic is a good choice at this stage, as it allows for simultaneous swaps of multiple nodes, which can lead to significant improvements in cut value by considering the combined effects of swaps. This aligns well with the idea of improving the current solution after a constructive phase. Running 15 steps provides a balance between computational cost and refinement potential, especially given the still-large number of unselected nodes.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 7.0
---Round 8---
Heuristic: highest_weight_edge_eb0c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: With 690 nodes still unselected and the graph having high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), it is a good time to focus on constructing the solution further by targeting high-weight edges. The `highest_weight_edge_eb0c` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it prioritizes edges with significant weight, which can lead to a substantial increase in the cut value. Running 15 steps ensures that we make meaningful progress while keeping the computation manageable.
Delta of Selected Node: 30
Delta of Cut Value: 23.0
---Round 9---
Heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a low imbalance ratio (0.01) and a substantial number of unselected nodes (660). The graph continues to exhibit high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), making it ideal to focus on carefully selecting individual nodes that maximize the cut value. Since the previous heuristic (`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`) provided only a small improvement in the cut value (Delta = 16.0), switching to `highest_delta_node_b31b` ensures a focus on node-level optimization to maximize the incremental gain in the cut value. Running 15 steps strikes a balance between progress and computational efficiency.
Delta of Selected Node: 15
Delta of Cut Value: 74.0
---Round 10---
Heuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a good cut value (369.0) and a low imbalance ratio (0.00625), but there are still a significant number of unselected nodes (645). This indicates that there is room for refinement. While `highest_delta_node_b31b` showed strong performance in the previous round (Delta Cut Value = 77.0), switching to `multi_swap_2_dbfe` is appropriate at this stage to explore the benefits of performing multi-node swaps. This approach can refine the solution more globally by considering the combined effects of multiple swaps, especially since single-node optimizations may start to yield diminishing returns. Running 15 steps balances computational cost and the potential for significant cut value improvement.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 13.0
---Round 11---
Heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a good cut value (379.0) and a very low imbalance ratio (0.00625). However, with 645 nodes still unselected, there is substantial room for further construction. Given the graph's high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), focusing on individual nodes that maximize the cut value remains a promising strategy. The `highest_delta_node_b31b` heuristic has consistently shown strong performance in prior rounds, with significant gains in cut value. Running 15 steps balances progress with computational efficiency, continuing the construction phase while preparing for future refinement.
Delta of Selected Node: 15
Delta of Cut Value: 80.0
---Round 12---
Heuristic: highest_weight_edge_eb0c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current solution has a relatively low imbalance ratio (0.0) and a significant number of nodes (630) still unselected. Given the high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), focusing on high-weight edges is a logical next step to continue constructing the solution. The `highest_weight_edge_eb0c` heuristic is suitable for this stage as it prioritizes edges with the highest weight, which can lead to meaningful improvements in the cut value while maintaining balance. Running 15 steps ensures progress without overcommitting to a single heuristic.
Delta of Selected Node: 30
Delta of Cut Value: 17.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: highest_weight_edge_eb0c. How does highest_weight_edge_eb0c perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b  
running steps: 15  
explanation: The current solution has a very low imbalance ratio (0.0) and a significant number of unselected nodes (600). The graph still exhibits high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), suggesting that selecting individual nodes with the highest delta in cut value remains an effective strategy. While the last heuristic (`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`) improved the cut value slightly (Delta = 28.0), focusing on `highest_delta_node_b31b` allows for more targeted node-level optimizations. Running 15 steps balances computational efficiency and potential cut value improvement.
