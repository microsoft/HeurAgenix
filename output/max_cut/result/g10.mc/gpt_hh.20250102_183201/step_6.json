                "text": "### Analysis of Scenarios for Each Heuristic\n\nBelow is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is most applicable, along with suggestions on how to quantify these scenarios:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **`balanced_cut_21d5`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for scenarios where the graph is dense or nearly balanced, and the goal is to maintain balance between the sizes of sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It is particularly effective in cases where the graph has uniform or close-to-uniform edge weights.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Node degree distribution is relatively uniform.\n     - The total number of nodes is even or close to even.\n     - High density of edges (e.g., density > 0.5).\n   - **Limitations**: May not perform well for highly skewed graphs where some nodes have significantly higher degrees than others.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **`greedy_swap_5bb5`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when the initial solution is already close to optimal, and only minor adjustments are needed to improve the cut value. It is best applied when the graph is sparse or when small, localized changes can significantly affect the cut value.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Initial solution cut value is close to the maximum cut value (e.g., within 10%).\n     - Sparse graph with low edge density (e.g., density < 0.3).\n     - Nodes with high degrees are already well-distributed between sets A and B.\n   - **Limitations**: Computationally expensive for dense graphs due to the need to evaluate every possible swap.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **`highest_delta_edge_9f66`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, and there are a few high-weight edges that dominate the cut value. It is effective in early stages of solution construction or refinement.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High variance in edge weights (e.g., standard deviation of edge weights > 0.5 \u00d7 mean edge weight).\n     - A significant number of high-weight edges remain unselected.\n   - **Limitations**: May lead to suboptimal solutions if applied in isolation, as it focuses only on edge weights without considering balance or node distribution.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **`highest_delta_node_b31b`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when the graph has nodes with highly varied degrees or when selecting a single node can significantly impact the cut value. It is particularly effective for graphs with hub-and-spoke structures.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High variance in node degrees (e.g., standard deviation of node degrees > 0.5 \u00d7 mean degree).\n     - Unselected nodes with high degrees remain in the graph.\n   - **Limitations**: May neglect global balance between sets A and B, focusing solely on local improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable to graphs where edge weights dominate the optimization problem. It works well in cases where adding specific high-weight edges early on can significantly affect the solution quality.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High variance in edge weights (similar to `highest_delta_edge_9f66`).\n     - A significant proportion of high-weight edges remain unselected.\n   - **Limitations**: May lead to imbalanced solutions if the focus on edge weights ignores node distribution.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **`most_weight_neighbors_320c`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic excels in graphs where local neighborhoods (nodes and their immediate connections) dominate the graph structure. It is effective for graphs with clusters or communities, where the goal is to iteratively select nodes with high connectivity to existing sets.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Strong community structure in the graph (e.g., modularity > 0.3).\n     - Nodes with high neighbor weights remain unselected.\n   - **Limitations**: May get stuck in local optima if the heuristic prioritizes local improvements over global balance.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **`multi_swap_2_dbfe`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable for scenarios where multiple swaps can collectively lead to a significant improvement in the cut value, even if individual swaps are not beneficial. It is particularly effective in dense graphs or graphs with complex interactions between nodes.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Dense graph with high edge density (e.g., density > 0.5).\n     - Current solution is far from optimal, and single-node swaps are insufficient to improve the cut value.\n   - **Limitations**: Computationally expensive, especially for large graphs with many nodes.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **`random_5c59`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best applied in the early stages of solution construction or as a diversification mechanism in metaheuristics. It is effective when there is little information about the problem structure or when escaping local optima.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Early-stage optimization with no prior knowledge of the graph structure.\n     - Used as part of an iterative metaheuristic (e.g., simulated annealing or genetic algorithms) to introduce randomness.\n   - **Limitations**: Inefficient for fine-tuning or refinement of solutions.\n\n---\n\n#### 9. **`simulated_annealing_ed14`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is highly effective for escaping local optima and exploring the solution space. It is applicable to both dense and sparse graphs, especially when the problem landscape has many local optima.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - The current solution is stuck in a local optimum (e.g., no improvement after several iterations of other heuristics).\n     - The cut value is far from the expected maximum (e.g., < 80% of the estimated maximum cut value).\n   - **Limitations**: May require careful tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., initial temperature, cooling rate) to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Scenarios and Quantification\n\n| **Heuristic**              | **Best Scenario**                                                                                  | **Quantification**                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `balanced_cut_21d5`         | Dense and balanced graphs                                                                          | Uniform node degree, even node count, edge density > 0.5                                              |\n| `greedy_swap_5bb5`          | Small adjustments to near-optimal solutions                                                       | Initial cut value near maximum, sparse graph (density < 0.3)                                          |\n| `highest_delta_edge_9f66`   | Graphs with dominant high-weight edges                                                            | High variance in edge weights                                                                         |\n| `highest_delta_node_b31b`   | Graphs with dominant high-degree nodes                                                            | High variance in node degrees                                                                         |\n| `highest_weight_edge_eb0c`  | Graphs where edge weights dominate optimization                                                   | Similar to `highest_delta_edge_9f66`                                                                 |\n| `most_weight_neighbors_320c`| Graphs with strong community structures                                                           | High modularity, high neighbor weights                                                               |\n| `multi_swap_2_dbfe`         | Dense graphs where multi-node swaps can significantly improve the cut                             | Dense graph (density > 0.5), far from optimal                                                        |\n| `random_5c59`               | Early-stage optimization or diversification in metaheuristics                                     | Early stage, lack of prior information                                                                |\n| `simulated_annealing_ed14`  | Graphs with many local optima                                                                     | Stuck in local optimum, cut value < 80% of maximum                                                   |\n\nThis"

At this stage, no nodes have been selected, and the imbalance ratio is 0.0. The heuristic `most_weight_neighbors_320c` can effectively construct an initial solution by iteratively selecting nodes with the highest weighted connections to maximize the cut value. Running 20 steps is appropriate given the large number of unselected nodes (800).\nDelta of Selected Node: 20\nDelta of Cut Value: 9.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: At this stage, we have constructed an initial solution with a small cut value (9.0) and a very low imbalance ratio (0.005). The graph is sparse (edge density = 0.06) with high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0). Since there are still a large number of unselected nodes (780, ~97.5% of total nodes), it is ideal to focus on adding edges that maximize the increase in cut weight. The `highest_delta_edge_9f66` heuristic is well-suited for this purpose as it prioritizes high-weight edges for inclusion. Running 15 steps ensures significant progress while keeping the computation manageable.\nDelta of Selected Node: 30\nDelta of Cut Value: 101.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_320c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The graph is still sparse (edge density = 0.06) and has a high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0). With 750 unselected nodes remaining (~93.75% of total), it is essential to continue constructing the solution by targeting nodes with high-weighted connections. The `most_weight_neighbors_320c` heuristic is ideal for this stage to maximize the cut value incrementally while ensuring high-quality node selection. Running 15 steps balances progress and computational cost.\nDelta of Selected Node: 15\nDelta of Cut Value: 20.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current imbalance ratio is low (0.01375), and the graph still has a large number of unselected nodes (735). With the edge weights exhibiting high variance (std_dev = ~1.0), it is appropriate to focus on selecting individual nodes that maximize the cut value. The `highest_delta_node_b31b` heuristic is effective at this stage because it evaluates the impact of each node on the cut weight and ensures incremental construction of a high-quality solution. Running 15 steps will allow for significant progress while maintaining computational efficiency.\nDelta of Selected Node: 15\nDelta of Cut Value: 61.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current solution has achieved a significant cut value (191.0) with a low imbalance ratio (0.0125), and a substantial portion of nodes remain unselected (720, 90%). While the solution is progressing well, the graph's high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0) suggests there may still be opportunities to escape potential local optima and explore better configurations. Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing_ed14`) is a suitable choice at this stage to probabilistically accept suboptimal swaps and further improve the solution by refining the partition. Running 15 steps is appropriate given the large number of unselected nodes and the need to explore the solution space efficiently.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: -7.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_320c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current solution has a low imbalance ratio (0.01) and a substantial number of unselected nodes (720, ~90%). Given the sparse nature of the graph (edge density = 0.06) and the high variance in edge weights (std_dev ~ 1.0), it is appropriate to focus on constructing the solution further by targeting nodes with high-weighted connections to maximize the cut value incrementally. The `most_weight_neighbors_320c` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it prioritizes high-quality node selection while maintaining balance between sets A and B. Running 15 steps balances progress and computational cost.\nDelta of Selected Node: 15\nDelta of Cut Value: 24.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: most_weight_neighbors_320c. How does most_weight_neighbors_320c perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
