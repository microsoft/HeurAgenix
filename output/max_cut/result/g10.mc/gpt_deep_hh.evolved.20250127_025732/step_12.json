It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Here's a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and execution steps for tackling the MaxCut problem:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### 1. **Initial Construction Phase**\n- **Objective**: Quickly build an initial feasible solution.\n- **Suggested Categories**:\n  - **Node Insertion**: Start with a heuristic like `highest_weight_edge_ca02` or `highest_delta_node_b31b` to construct an initial solution by focusing on high-impact nodes.\n  - **Greedy**: Use greedy approaches to establish a strong initial cut value, focusing on immediate gains.\n\n#### 2. **Initial Improvement Phase**\n- **Objective**: Improve the initial solution to escape local optima and enhance the cut value.\n- **Suggested Categories**:\n  - **Swap-Based**: Implement `greedy_swap_5bb5` to make local improvements by swapping nodes.\n  - **Balancing/Partitioning**: Use `balanced_cut_c0e6` to ensure that the partitions remain balanced while improving the cut value.\n\n#### 3. **Exploration Phase**\n- **Objective**: Explore the solution space more broadly to escape local optima and discover better solutions.\n- **Suggested Categories**:\n  - **Probabilistic/Metaheuristic**: Deploy `simulated_annealing_ed14` to explore the solution space stochastically, allowing temporary acceptance of worse solutions for greater long-term gains.\n  - **Edge Insertion**: Use `highest_delta_edge_9f66` to fine-tune the solution by focusing on edge contributions.\n\n#### 4. **Intensive Improvement Phase**\n- **Objective**: Intensively improve the solution by exploring and exploiting local changes.\n- **Suggested Categories**:\n  - **Swap-Based**: Utilize `multi_swap_2_dbfe` for complex swaps that consider multiple nodes at once.\n  - **Balancing/Partitioning**: Revisit `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to ensure optimal balance and partition quality.\n\n### Execution Steps\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with Node Insertion or Greedy heuristics to quickly form an initial solution.\n2. **Local Improvement**: Apply Swap-Based heuristics to make quick, effective improvements.\n3. **Balancing**: Use Balancing/Partitioning to ensure the solution remains robustly partitioned.\n4. **Exploration**: Integrate Probabilistic/Metaheuristic strategies to explore beyond local optima.\n5. **Final Optimization**: Revisit Swap-Based and Edge Insertion heuristics to fine-tune the final solution.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n\n- **Evaluate and Adapt**: After each phase, assess the cut value improvements. If progress stalls, switch to another category.\n- **Time Management**: Allocate time for each phase based on initial results, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n- **Feedback Loop**: Continuously use feedback from each phase to inform subsequent heuristic choices and execution steps.\n\nThis strategic guide provides a structured approach to heuristic selection, ensuring diverse exploration and exploitation throughout the optimization process.

Node Insertion heuristics are well-suited for starting the process by placing high-impact nodes into the sets to quickly develop an initial feasible solution. This will help in setting a foundation for further improvements.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: Node Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution is still in its early stages, with only one node placed into set A and no cut value improvement yet. Continuing with the Node Insertion category can help further develop the solution by adding more nodes with potentially high impact on the cut value. This will build a stronger initial structure, providing a better foundation for subsequent improvement phases.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: Node Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution is still in its early development stage with only two nodes selected and a low cut value. Continuing with the Node Insertion category is sensible to further develop the initial solution, especially since previous steps have begun to show some improvement in the cut value. Building a more robust initial solution will provide a stronger foundation for later phases, allowing for more effective application of other heuristics.\nSelected Node: 2->3\nCut Value: 1.0->2.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe\nHeuristic Category: Swap-Based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has a small number of selected nodes, and the cut value is beginning to develop. Moving to the Swap-Based category could help optimize the placement of the already selected nodes, potentially improving the cut value by swapping nodes between the two sets. This approach will also start balancing the partition more effectively, given the current imbalance ratio, and further develop the solution structure.\nSelected Node: 3->3\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: Balancing/Partitioning\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  0.00125). Utilizing a Balancing/Partitioning heuristic can help address this imbalance, improving the cut value by ensuring a more even distribution of nodes between the sets. This will provide a more robust foundation for future optimization steps.\nSelected Node: 3->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nHeuristic Category: Probabilistic/Metaheuristic\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution with a low cut value and the small number of nodes selected, it might be beneficial to explore the solution space more broadly using a Probabilistic/Metaheuristic approach. This can help escape local optima and potentially identify a better configuration. Simulated Annealing, for instance, would allow temporary acceptance of worse solutions to explore new areas of the search space, possibly leading to a more substantial improvement.\nSelected Node: 4->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe\nHeuristic Category: Swap-Based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution with only a few selected nodes and a low cut value, focusing on optimizing the placement of these nodes could be beneficial. The previous rounds have primarily been about constructing the initial solution, and now, with a small set of selected nodes, a Swap-Based heuristic may help fine-tune the solution. It can potentially improve the cut value by evaluating and performing advantageous swaps, which may also help address any initial partition imbalances. This approach can enhance the effectiveness of the current solution configuration, preparing it for further optimization phases.\nSelected Node: 4->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: Edge Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has a low cut value and a small number of selected nodes. To improve the cut value, it may be beneficial to focus on increasing the contribution of edges between the two sets. Edge Insertion heuristics can help identify and add edges that maximize the cut value, potentially enhancing the solution more effectively at this stage. Given the current imbalance and the goal to increase cut value, introducing impactful edges could lead to significant improvements.\nSelected Node: 4->6\nCut Value: 2.0->6.0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nHeuristic Category: Swap-Based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution shows an improvement in the cut value with the latest Edge Insertion heuristic, but the solution is still in its early stages with a small number of selected nodes. To further enhance the solution, focusing on optimizing the placement of the selected nodes through swaps could be beneficial. Swap-Based heuristics can help refine the current partitioning by evaluating potential swaps that may increase the cut value further. This approach can effectively address any local imbalances and improve the overall quality of the solution configuration, preparing it for more robust optimization in subsequent phases.\nSelected Node: 6->6\nCut Value: 6.0->6.0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: Edge Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution shows a small number of selected nodes with a modest cut value. While swap-based heuristics have helped in the past, the low selected node ratio and the need to increase the cut value suggest a focus on enhancing edge contributions between sets. Edge Insertion heuristics can help identify and add edges that maximize the cut value, potentially leading to significant improvements at this stage of the optimization process.\nSelected Node: 6->8\nCut Value: 6.0->11.0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: Edge Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has shown improvement with the Edge Insertion heuristic, achieving a cut value of 11.0. Given the recent success and the modest number of selected nodes, continuing with Edge Insertion could further enhance the cut value by adding more impactful edges. This approach can capitalize on the existing edge contributions and potentially lead to significant improvements in the cut value, especially considering the low selected nodes ratio and the need to increase the cut value further.\nSelected Node: 8->10\nCut Value: 11.0->16.0\n---Round 11---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: Edge Insertion\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the recent success with the Edge Insertion heuristic, which has significantly improved the cut value, continuing with this category seems promising. The current solution has shown that adding impactful edges can effectively enhance the cut value. With a low number of selected nodes and a good imbalance ratio, further edge insertion could capitalize on the existing momentum and drive more improvement in the cut value.\nSelected Node: 10->12\nCut Value: 16.0->20.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 96,549,401,689,148,670\nset_b: 772,390,231,276,90,509\n\nset_a_count:6\nset_b_count:6\nselected_nodes:{96, 772, 549, 390, 231, 401, 689, 148, 276, 90, 509, 670}\nselected_num:12\nunselected_num:788\ncurrent_cut_value:20.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.0\ncut_value:20.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:1.6666666666666667\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.015\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.985\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0.12888888888888891\nboundary_node_ratio:0.015\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: highest_delta_edge_9f66(Edge Insertion).
