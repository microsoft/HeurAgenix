Let's analyze the scenarios where each algorithm you\u2019ve implemented for the Max Cut problem would be most applicable, and discuss how these scenarios can be best quantified.\n\n### 1. **Balanced Cut Heuristic (balanced_cut_21d5)**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when a balanced partition is desired, i.e., the number of nodes in sets A and B should be nearly equal.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Imbalance Metric: `|set_a_count - set_b_count|`\n     - Iteration Limit: Number of iterations to achieve balance.\n   - **Best For**: Graphs where an equal distribution of nodes is crucial, such as in load balancing problems.\n\n### 2. **Multi-Swap Heuristic (multi_swap_2_dbfe)**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when there is potential for significant improvement by swapping pairs of nodes simultaneously, rather than one at a time.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Swap Impact: The change in cut value from swapping pairs of nodes.\n     - Computational Resources: Availability of resources to handle potentially high computational complexity.\n   - **Best For**: Dense graphs where single-node swaps might be insufficient to find the optimal solution.\n\n### 3. **Random Node Insertion Heuristic (random_5c59)**\n   - **Scenario**: Useful for initial exploration or when a diverse set of solutions is needed to avoid local optima.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Randomness Level: Degree of randomness in node selection.\n     - Iteration Count: Number of iterations to generate diverse solutions.\n   - **Best For**: Large graphs where a good initial solution can be refined by other heuristics later.\n\n### 4. **Most Weight Neighbors Heuristic (most_weight_neighbors_320c)**\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when the goal is to maximize the immediate cut value by considering nodes with high connectivity.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Neighbor Weight Sum: Total weight of edges connected to an unselected node.\n   - **Best For**: Graphs with a few highly connected nodes (hubs).\n\n### 5. **Highest Delta Edge Heuristic (highest_delta_edge_9f66)**\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable when edges have significantly varying weights and selecting the right edge can vastly improve the cut value.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Delta Cut Value: Change in cut value from adding an edge.\n   - **Best For**: Sparse graphs or graphs with high edge weight variance.\n\n### 6. **Highest Delta Node Heuristic (highest_delta_node_b31b)**\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when focusing on node-level decisions to maximize the cut value.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Delta Cut Value: Change in cut value from adding a node to a set.\n   - **Best For**: Graphs where individual nodes have a significant impact on the cut value.\n\n### 7. **Simulated Annealing Heuristic (simulated_annealing_ed14)**\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for escaping local optima by allowing probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions initially.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Temperature Schedule: Rate at which the acceptance probability of worse solutions decreases.\n     - Convergence Rate: Number of iterations to reach a stable solution.\n   - **Best For**: Complex graphs with many local optima.\n\n### 8. **Highest Weight Edge Heuristic (highest_weight_edge_eb0c)**\n   - **Scenario**: Effective when targeting the most influential edges to maximize the cut value.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Edge Weight: Weight of the edge being considered.\n   - **Best For**: Graphs with a few edges having significantly higher weights than the rest.\n\n### 9. **Greedy Swap Heuristic (greedy_swap_5bb5)**\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for incremental improvement by evaluating and performing the best single-node swap.\n   - **Quantified By**:\n     - Swap Impact: Change in cut value from a single-node swap.\n   - **Best For**: Graphs where local improvements can lead to a globally optimal solution.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the scenarios for applying each heuristic can be quantified using various metrics such as imbalance, impact on cut value, and computational resources. These heuristics are best applied based on the graph's properties (e.g., density, edge weight variance, connectivity) and the specific goals of the optimization (e.g., balance, avoiding local optima, maximizing immediate cut value).\n\nFeel free to describe the specific challenges you're encountering, and we can delve into the details to resolve them."

How does greedy_swap_5bb5 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
