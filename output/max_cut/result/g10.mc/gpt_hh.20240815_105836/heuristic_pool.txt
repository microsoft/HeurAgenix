I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_21d5(max_iterations: int = 100) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """
    Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B
    while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or
    the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

    Args): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def highest_weight_edge_eb0c(): Selects an edge with the highest weight where both nodes are unselected and adds each node to opposite sets, choosing the set that maximizes the cut value increase for each node.
def most_weight_neighbors_320c(): This heuristic selects an unselected node that has the highest sum of weights connected to it and inserts it into one of the sets (A or B) in the Solution, aiming to maximize the cut value. It stores the sorted list of unselected nodes based on the sum of weights for future use.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Let's analyze the scenarios where each algorithm you’ve implemented for the Max Cut problem would be most applicable, and discuss how these scenarios can be best quantified.

### 1. **Balanced Cut Heuristic (balanced_cut_21d5)**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when a balanced partition is desired, i.e., the number of nodes in sets A and B should be nearly equal.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Imbalance Metric: `|set_a_count - set_b_count|`
     - Iteration Limit: Number of iterations to achieve balance.
   - **Best For**: Graphs where an equal distribution of nodes is crucial, such as in load balancing problems.

### 2. **Multi-Swap Heuristic (multi_swap_2_dbfe)**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when there is potential for significant improvement by swapping pairs of nodes simultaneously, rather than one at a time.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Swap Impact: The change in cut value from swapping pairs of nodes.
     - Computational Resources: Availability of resources to handle potentially high computational complexity.
   - **Best For**: Dense graphs where single-node swaps might be insufficient to find the optimal solution.

### 3. **Random Node Insertion Heuristic (random_5c59)**
   - **Scenario**: Useful for initial exploration or when a diverse set of solutions is needed to avoid local optima.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Randomness Level: Degree of randomness in node selection.
     - Iteration Count: Number of iterations to generate diverse solutions.
   - **Best For**: Large graphs where a good initial solution can be refined by other heuristics later.

### 4. **Most Weight Neighbors Heuristic (most_weight_neighbors_320c)**
   - **Scenario**: Effective when the goal is to maximize the immediate cut value by considering nodes with high connectivity.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Neighbor Weight Sum: Total weight of edges connected to an unselected node.
   - **Best For**: Graphs with a few highly connected nodes (hubs).

### 5. **Highest Delta Edge Heuristic (highest_delta_edge_9f66)**
   - **Scenario**: Suitable when edges have significantly varying weights and selecting the right edge can vastly improve the cut value.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Delta Cut Value: Change in cut value from adding an edge.
   - **Best For**: Sparse graphs or graphs with high edge weight variance.

### 6. **Highest Delta Node Heuristic (highest_delta_node_b31b)**
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when focusing on node-level decisions to maximize the cut value.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Delta Cut Value: Change in cut value from adding a node to a set.
   - **Best For**: Graphs where individual nodes have a significant impact on the cut value.

### 7. **Simulated Annealing Heuristic (simulated_annealing_ed14)**
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for escaping local optima by allowing probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions initially.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Temperature Schedule: Rate at which the acceptance probability of worse solutions decreases.
     - Convergence Rate: Number of iterations to reach a stable solution.
   - **Best For**: Complex graphs with many local optima.

### 8. **Highest Weight Edge Heuristic (highest_weight_edge_eb0c)**
   - **Scenario**: Effective when targeting the most influential edges to maximize the cut value.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Edge Weight: Weight of the edge being considered.
   - **Best For**: Graphs with a few edges having significantly higher weights than the rest.

### 9. **Greedy Swap Heuristic (greedy_swap_5bb5)**
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for incremental improvement by evaluating and performing the best single-node swap.
   - **Quantified By**:
     - Swap Impact: Change in cut value from a single-node swap.
   - **Best For**: Graphs where local improvements can lead to a globally optimal solution.

### Summary
In summary, the scenarios for applying each heuristic can be quantified using various metrics such as imbalance, impact on cut value, and computational resources. These heuristics are best applied based on the graph's properties (e.g., density, edge weight variance, connectivity) and the specific goals of the optimization (e.g., balance, avoiding local optima, maximizing immediate cut value).

Feel free to describe the specific challenges you're encountering, and we can delve into the details to resolve them.
