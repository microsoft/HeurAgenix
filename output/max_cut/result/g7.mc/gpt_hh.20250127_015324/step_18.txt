I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.

The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.
def balanced_cut_21d5(max_iterations: int = 100) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """
    Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B
    while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or
    the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

    Args): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def highest_weight_edge_eb0c(): Selects an edge with the highest weight where both nodes are unselected and adds each node to opposite sets, choosing the set that maximizes the cut value increase for each node.
def most_weight_neighbors_320c(): This heuristic selects an unselected node that has the highest sum of weights connected to it and inserts it into one of the sets (A or B) in the Solution, aiming to maximize the cut value. It stores the sorted list of unselected nodes based on the sum of weights for future use.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the applicability and quantifying scenarios for each heuristic algorithm for the Max Cut problem can provide insights into when each approach is most effective. Here’s an overview of scenarios where each heuristic might be best suited:

1. **Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing_ed14`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Useful in large, complex graphs where local optima are a concern. The probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions helps in exploring the solution space more broadly.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with high connectivity or irregular edge weights where simple greedy methods might get stuck in local optima.

2. **Balanced Cut (`balanced_cut_21d5`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for graphs where a balanced partition (equal number of nodes in each set) is crucial or beneficial.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where node distribution needs to be balanced due to constraints or when initial solutions are highly imbalanced.

3. **Random Node Insertion (`random_5c59`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable as a baseline or starting point for other heuristics. Useful in exploratory phases or when randomization is needed to escape patterns.
   - **Quantification**: Best for generating diverse initial solutions or when combined with other heuristics for diversification.

4. **Highest Delta Edge (`highest_delta_edge_9f66`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, allowing significant cut value improvements by selecting optimal edges.
   - **Quantification**: Most effective in sparse graphs with a few high-weight edges that can drastically affect the cut value.

5. **Greedy Swap (`greedy_swap_5bb5`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where local improvements are expected to lead to optimal or near-optimal solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in moderately connected graphs or when the solution is near optimal and requires fine-tuning.

6. **Highest Delta Node (`highest_delta_node_b31b`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in graphs with distinct node weights or connectivity patterns, where individual node placement can significantly impact cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where node degree or weight distribution is non-uniform.

7. **Multi Swap (`multi_swap_2_dbfe`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Useful in graphs where combined effects of node swaps can lead to better solutions compared to individual swaps.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in dense graphs or those where node interactions are complex and intertwined.

8. **Highest Weight Edge (`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in scenarios with high-weight edges dominating the graph, where selecting such edges is crucial for maximizing cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with a few dominant edges that can significantly alter the solution.

9. **Most Weight Neighbors (`most_weight_neighbors_320c`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where node connectivity and cumulative edge weight play a crucial role in determining solution quality.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in graphs with clusters of highly connected nodes or when aiming to prioritize node incorporation based on connectivity.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for different types of graphs and scenarios. The choice of heuristic will depend on the specific characteristics of the graph, such as size, edge weight distribution, and connectivity patterns.

Explain: The "Greedy Swap" heuristic is selected to explore potential swaps between set A and set B that could enhance the cut value. Given the diminishing returns from the previous heuristic, this approach aims to fine-tune the solution by considering swaps that maximize the cut value incrementally. Running it for 20 steps provides a balance between exploration and potential improvement, allowing for reassessment based on the results.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 46.0

Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The "Greedy Swap" heuristic has shown a positive impact on the cut value in the last round with an increase of 46.0, indicating potential for further improvement. Given the diminishing returns from previous heuristics, continuing with "Greedy Swap" for an additional 15 steps will allow for fine-tuning of the solution by exploring beneficial node swaps between sets A and B. This approach provides a balanced opportunity to enhance the solution without overcommitting to a lengthy execution, allowing for reassessment based on the outcomes.

Delta of Cut Value: 0.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_swap_5bb5. How does greedy_swap_5bb5 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Based on the current data and the performance of previous heuristics, here's the analysis:

- The "Greedy Swap" heuristic has shown a positive impact in Round 16 with an increase in the cut value, but did not improve in Round 17. This suggests that it may have reached its local optima or effectiveness limit under current conditions.
- The edge weight variance and the boundary node ratio are relatively high, suggesting that there might still be room for improvement by focusing on high-impact edges or nodes.

Given these observations and considering the diminishing returns from the "Greedy Swap," it might be beneficial to explore another heuristic that can capitalize on the edge weight variance and potentially introduce variability into the solution.

Here's a suggestion for the next steps:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b
running steps: 15
explanation: The "Highest Delta Node" heuristic can leverage the significant variance in edge weights to find nodes that, when added, can maximize the cut value. This approach can help in identifying high-impact nodes that were not previously considered, potentially enhancing the solution by capitalizing on unselected nodes.
