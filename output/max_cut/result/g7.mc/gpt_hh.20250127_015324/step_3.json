Here\u2019s an overview of scenarios where each heuristic might be best suited:\n\n1. **Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing_ed14`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Useful in large, complex graphs where local optima are a concern. The probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions helps in exploring the solution space more broadly.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with high connectivity or irregular edge weights where simple greedy methods might get stuck in local optima.\n\n2. **Balanced Cut (`balanced_cut_21d5`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for graphs where a balanced partition (equal number of nodes in each set) is crucial or beneficial.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where node distribution needs to be balanced due to constraints or when initial solutions are highly imbalanced.\n\n3. **Random Node Insertion (`random_5c59`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Applicable as a baseline or starting point for other heuristics. Useful in exploratory phases or when randomization is needed to escape patterns.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for generating diverse initial solutions or when combined with other heuristics for diversification.\n\n4. **Highest Delta Edge (`highest_delta_edge_9f66`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, allowing significant cut value improvements by selecting optimal edges.\n   - **Quantification**: Most effective in sparse graphs with a few high-weight edges that can drastically affect the cut value.\n\n5. **Greedy Swap (`greedy_swap_5bb5`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where local improvements are expected to lead to optimal or near-optimal solutions.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in moderately connected graphs or when the solution is near optimal and requires fine-tuning.\n\n6. **Highest Delta Node (`highest_delta_node_b31b`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in graphs with distinct node weights or connectivity patterns, where individual node placement can significantly impact cut value.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where node degree or weight distribution is non-uniform.\n\n7. **Multi Swap (`multi_swap_2_dbfe`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Useful in graphs where combined effects of node swaps can lead to better solutions compared to individual swaps.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in dense graphs or those where node interactions are complex and intertwined.\n\n8. **Highest Weight Edge (`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in scenarios with high-weight edges dominating the graph, where selecting such edges is crucial for maximizing cut value.\n   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with a few dominant edges that can significantly alter the solution.\n\n9. **Most Weight Neighbors (`most_weight_neighbors_320c`)**:\n   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where node connectivity and cumulative edge weight play a crucial role in determining solution quality.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in graphs with clusters of highly connected nodes or when aiming to prioritize node incorporation based on connectivity.\n\nEach heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for different types of graphs and scenarios.

How does simulated_annealing_ed14 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
