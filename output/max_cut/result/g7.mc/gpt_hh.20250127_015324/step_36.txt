I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.
def balanced_cut_21d5(max_iterations: int = 100) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """
    Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B
    while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or
    the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

    Args): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem. This heuristic tries to balance the number of nodes in sets A and B while maximizing the cut value. It iteratively adds nodes to the smaller set until a balanced state is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.

It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.

It stores the sorted list of unselected nodes based on the sum of weights for future use.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the applicability and quantifying scenarios for each heuristic algorithm for the Max Cut problem can provide insights into when each approach is most effective. Here’s an overview of scenarios where each heuristic might be best suited:

1. **Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing_ed14`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Useful in large, complex graphs where local optima are a concern. The probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions helps in exploring the solution space more broadly.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with high connectivity or irregular edge weights where simple greedy methods might get stuck in local optima.

2. **Balanced Cut (`balanced_cut_21d5`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for graphs where a balanced partition (equal number of nodes in each set) is crucial or beneficial.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in scenarios where node distribution needs to be balanced due to constraints or when initial solutions are highly imbalanced.

3. **Random Node Insertion (`random_5c59`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable as a baseline or starting point for other heuristics. Useful in exploratory phases or when randomization is needed to escape patterns.
   - **Quantification**: Best for generating diverse initial solutions or when combined with other heuristics for diversification.

4. **Highest Delta Edge (`highest_delta_edge_9f66`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where edge weights vary significantly, allowing significant cut value improvements by selecting optimal edges.
   - **Quantification**: Most effective in sparse graphs with a few high-weight edges that can drastically affect the cut value.

5. **Greedy Swap (`greedy_swap_5bb5`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where local improvements are expected to lead to optimal or near-optimal solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in moderately connected graphs or when the solution is near optimal and requires fine-tuning.

6. **Highest Delta Node (`highest_delta_node_b31b`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in graphs with distinct node weights or connectivity patterns, where individual node placement can significantly impact cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs where node degree or weight distribution is non-uniform.

7. **Multi Swap (`multi_swap_2_dbfe`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Useful in graphs where combined effects of node swaps can lead to better solutions compared to individual swaps.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in dense graphs or those where node interactions are complex and intertwined.

8. **Highest Weight Edge (`highest_weight_edge_eb0c`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Applicable in scenarios with high-weight edges dominating the graph, where selecting such edges is crucial for maximizing cut value.
   - **Quantification**: Best for graphs with a few dominant edges that can significantly alter the solution.

9. **Most Weight Neighbors (`most_weight_neighbors_320c`)**:
   - **Scenarios**: Ideal for graphs where node connectivity and cumulative edge weight play a crucial role in determining solution quality.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in graphs with clusters of highly connected nodes or when aiming to prioritize node incorporation based on connectivity.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is best suited for different types of graphs and scenarios. The choice of heuristic will depend on the specific characteristics of the graph, such as size, edge weight distribution, and connectivity patterns.

---Round 29---
Heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The "Simulated Annealing" heuristic can help explore the solution space more broadly and potentially escape local optima. Its probabilistic nature allows for wider exploration, which may lead to improvements in the cut value by accepting worse solutions early on and converging to better solutions over time. Given the previous lack of improvement with "Greedy Swap," this approach aims to introduce variability and explore new configurations.

Heuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The "Highest Delta Edge" heuristic has consistently improved the cut value in earlier rounds and is well-suited to leveraging edge weight variance. Returning to this heuristic allows us to capitalize on high-impact edges, with a moderate step count providing a balance between exploration and improvement.

Heuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The "Highest Delta Edge" heuristic has previously demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing the cut value by capitalizing on high-impact edges. Despite recent diminishing returns, its potential to leverage edge weight variance remains relevant. Running it for 20 steps provides an opportunity to reassess its impact on the current solution, especially given the current state with a balanced node distribution and significant edge weight variance.

Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The "Greedy Swap" heuristic has previously shown the ability to fine-tune the solution by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B. Considering the recent decrease in cut value from "Highest Delta Edge" and the current balance of node distribution, "Greedy Swap" could help regain improvements and incrementally enhance the solution. Running it for 15 steps provides a balanced opportunity for potential improvement without overcommitting.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 37.0
---Round 33---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The "Greedy Swap" heuristic has previously shown the ability to fine-tune the solution by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B. The recent application of this heuristic resulted in a positive delta of 37.0 in the cut value, indicating its potential for further improvement. Given the balance in node distribution and the significant variance in edge weights, running it for 10 more steps provides an opportunity to achieve incremental enhancements while minimizing the risk of diminishing returns. This approach allows for reassessment after a shorter execution interval.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: highest_delta_edge_9f66. How does highest_delta_edge_9f66 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Based on the summary of previous heuristic applications and the current state of the solution, it appears that while "Highest Delta Edge" has been effective in the past, its recent performance has been declining, as evidenced by the negative delta in cut value. This suggests that its effectiveness may be diminishing at this stage. Additionally, the "Greedy Swap" heuristic has recently shown some potential for improvement, but it too seems to have reached a plateau.

Given these observations, a fresh approach might be necessary to explore new possibilities for solution improvement. Considering the global data, particularly the edge weight variance and the current cut value, a heuristic that can explore new configurations or refine the solution further could be beneficial.

Therefore, I propose the following action:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14
running steps: 15
explanation: The "Simulated Annealing" heuristic provides a probabilistic exploration of the solution space, which can be advantageous in escaping local optima and exploring new configurations. Given the diminishing returns of the "Highest Delta Edge" and "Greedy Swap" heuristics, this approach can help introduce variability and potentially lead to a better solution. Running it for 15 steps allows for exploration while minimizing the risk of further negative impact, providing an opportunity to reassess its effectiveness after a shorter execution interval.
