Given the recent decrease in cut value from \"Simulated Annealing,\" this heuristic can help in fine-tuning the solution by evaluating beneficial swaps that maximize the cut value incrementally. Running it for an additional 15 steps allows for further refinement of the solution, especially considering the current proximity of set counts and edge weight variance.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 15.0\n---Round 25---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The \"Greedy Swap\" heuristic has shown potential in enhancing the cut value by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B. Given the recent improvement in cut value after its application, continuing with it for another 15 steps provides an opportunity to further fine-tune the solution. The proximity of set counts and edge weight variance suggests that ongoing application could yield additional incremental improvements in the cut value.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 26---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The \"Greedy Swap\" heuristic has shown potential for enhancing the cut value by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B. Although recent improvements have been modest, continuing for 10 more steps allows for further refinement of the solution. This approach balances the potential for incremental improvements with the risk of diminishing returns, providing an opportunity to reassess its effectiveness after a shorter interval. Given the current proximity of set counts and edge weight variance, ongoing application could yield additional benefits.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 0.0\n---Round 27---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The \"Greedy Swap\" heuristic has shown potential for enhancing the cut value by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B.

Although recent improvements have been limited, continuing for 10 more steps allows for further refinement of the solution.

Its probabilistic nature allows for wider exploration, which may lead to improvements in the cut value by accepting worse solutions early on and converging to better solutions over time. Given the previous lack of improvement with \"Greedy Swap,\" this approach aims to introduce variability and explore new configurations.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: -8.0\n---Round 30---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The \"Highest Delta Edge\" heuristic has consistently improved the cut value in earlier rounds and is well-suited to leveraging edge weight variance. Returning to this heuristic allows us to capitalize on high-impact edges, with a moderate step count providing a balance between exploration and improvement.\nDelta of Selected Node: 40\nDelta of Cut Value: -8.0\n---Round 31---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The \"Highest Delta Edge\" heuristic has previously demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing the cut value by capitalizing on high-impact edges. Despite recent diminishing returns, its potential to leverage edge weight variance remains relevant. Running it for 20 steps provides an opportunity to reassess its impact on the current solution, especially given the current state with a balanced node distribution and significant edge weight variance.\nDelta of Selected Node: 40\nDelta of Cut Value: -82.0\n---Round 32---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The \"Greedy Swap\" heuristic has previously shown the ability to fine-tune the solution by optimizing node swaps between sets A and B. Considering the recent decrease in cut value from \"Highest Delta Edge\" and the current balance of node distribution, \"Greedy Swap\" could help regain improvements and incrementally enhance the solution. Running it for 15 steps provides a balanced opportunity for potential improvement without overcommitting.\nDelta of Selected Node: 0\nDelta of Cut Value: 37.0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: greedy_swap_5bb5. How does greedy_swap_5bb5 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
