Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for the Max Cut problem, we can structure the process into two main phases: the construction phase and the improvement phase. Each phase will have a set of heuristic categories that can be utilized based on the current state of the solution and the characteristics of the problem data. Here\u2019s a framework to guide your decision-making process:\n\n### Construction Phase\n\n1. **Initial Setup**\n   - **Objective**: Create an initial feasible solution that serves as a starting point for further improvement.\n   - **Heuristic Categories**: \n     - **Immediate Gain**: Begin with heuristics like `highest_delta_node_b31b` or `highest_delta_edge_9f66` to quickly establish a solution with a reasonable cut value. This is crucial for leveraging the immediate structure of the graph.\n     - **Balance Optimization**: Use `balanced_cut_c0e6` to ensure that the initial partition is well-balanced, which can help avoid heavily skewed partitions that could be difficult to improve later.\n\n2. **Exploration**\n   - **Objective**: Explore different configurations to avoid local optima and diversify the solution space.\n   - **Heuristic Categories**:\n     - **Neighbor Based**: Implement `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to choose nodes that are most connected to the opposite set, which can help in identifying potentially beneficial nodes to adjust early in the process.\n\n### Improvement Phase\n\n1. **Local Enhancement**\n   - **Objective**: Refine the current solution by making small, targeted improvements.\n   - **Heuristic Categories**:\n     - **Local Search**: Use `greedy_swap_5bb5` and `multi_swap_2_dbfe` to perform detailed local optimizations. Focus on refining the solution by swapping nodes to maximize the cut value.\n     - **Simulated Annealing**: Introduce `simulated_annealing_ed14` to probabilistically explore less favorable moves that might lead to better solutions, helping to escape potential local optima.\n\n2. **Balancing and Re-evaluation**\n   - **Objective**: Periodically re-balance the partition and reassess the solution's quality.\n   - **Heuristic Categories**:\n     - **Balance Optimization**: Re-apply `balanced_cut_c0e6` to maintain a balanced partition, which is essential in cases where the solution has skewed due to aggressive local optimizations.\n     - **Neighbor Based**: Re-evaluate using `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to identify and incorporate nodes that could improve the balance or cut weight.\n\n3. **Dynamic Adjustment**\n   - **Objective**: Adapt the strategy based on the solution\u2019s progress and problem characteristics.\n   - **Heuristic Categories**:\n     - Alternate between different heuristic categories depending on the performance observed so far. If a particular heuristic category shows diminishing returns, switch to another to explore new opportunities for improvement.\n\n### Execution Steps\n\n- **Iterative Process**: Alternate between construction and improvement phases, experimenting with different heuristics in each category.\n- **Evaluation**: After each iteration, assess the impact of the applied heuristics by measuring changes in the cut value and balance.\n- **Switching Strategy**: Be prepared to switch heuristics if the current strategy does not yield improvements. Use performance metrics to guide these decisions.\n- **Testing and Validation**: Ensure each new solution is valid using the `validation_solution` function and adjust strategies based on its feedback.\n\nThis strategic guide is designed to be flexible, allowing you to adapt your approach based on the evolving needs of the problem and the effectiveness of each heuristic. By alternating between different heuristics and phases, you can effectively explore the solution space and iteratively improve the Max Cut solution."

Using heuristics like `highest_delta_node_b31b` or `highest_delta_edge_9f66`, we can begin to construct an initial partition by adding nodes or edges that immediately maximize the cut weight. This will help create a baseline solution to further refine in subsequent phases.\nSelected Node: 0->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_edge_9f66\nHeuristic Category: immediate_gain\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the current solution has just begun forming with only two nodes selected and a minimal cut value, continuing with the immediate gain category can help further develop the initial partition quickly. This approach will allow for additional nodes or edges that provide the highest immediate increase in the cut value, enhancing the foundational solution before considering more complex strategies.\nSelected Node: 2->4\nCut Value: 1.0->4.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: balance_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the current solution has started forming and there is an imbalance between the partitions (with only two nodes in each set), it would be strategic to switch to the balance_optimization category. This will help in maintaining a balanced partition while continuing to develop the solution. Using a heuristic like `balanced_cut_c0e6` could ensure that the partitions grow in a balanced manner, which is crucial for achieving a high-quality solution in later stages.\nSelected Node: 4->4\nCut Value: 4.0->2.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: neighbor_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the current solution has a balanced partition but a relatively low cut value, switching to the neighbor_based category could help in identifying nodes that have strong connections across the partitions. This can improve the cut value by leveraging nodes with high weighted connections to the opposite set, potentially enhancing the current solution effectively.\nSelected Node: 4->5\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 0,65,53\nset_b: 12,69\n\nset_a_count:3\nset_b_count:2\nselected_nodes:{0, 65, 69, 12, 53}\nselected_num:5\nunselected_num:795\ncurrent_cut_value:2.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.00125\ncut_value:2.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:0.4\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.00625\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.99375\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0.25\nboundary_node_ratio:0.00625\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: most_weight_neighbors_d31b(neighbor_based). How it works?\nShould me:\n- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or\n- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nWe intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: balance_optimization,immediate_gain,local_search,simulated_annealing,neighbor_based\n\nThe response format is very important.\n1.
