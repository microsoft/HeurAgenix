I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

MaxCut is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem and can be approached using heuristic methods. Your framework, including the Solution and Operator classes, appears to be structured appropriately for applying various heuristic algorithms to solve the MaxCut problem.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.
def highest_weight_edge_ca02(): Heuristic algorithm to maximize cut value by evaluating the impact of placing each unselected node into set A or B.
def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.
def greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.
def highest_delta_edge_9f66(): Selects the unselected edge that maximizes the increase in cut weight when added to the solution.
def highest_delta_node_b31b(): This heuristic selects the unselected node that, when added to one of the sets (A or B), would result in the largest increase in the total cut weight. The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.
def multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.
def random_5c59(): Random node insertion heuristic for Max Cut.
def simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem. It probabilistically chooses to swap a node from one set to another, potentially accepting worse solutions early on to escape local optima, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios in which each heuristic might be most applicable involves considering the characteristics of the problem instance, such as graph density, weight distribution, size, and desired trade-offs between solution quality and computational efficiency. Here's an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **balanced_cut_c0e6()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when partitions need to be balanced in size, which can be important in applications where the two sets must be of comparable size (e.g., load balancing problems).
   - **Quantification**: Best quantified by measuring the size difference between the two sets and the cut value.

2. **highest_weight_edge_ca02()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective for graphs where high-weight edges are sparse but crucial, as it focuses on maximizing the cut by prioritizing edge weights.
   - **Quantification**: Performance can be quantified by the total weight of the cut compared to the total weight of all edges.

3. **most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor, swap_frequency)**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for graphs where both local and future impacts of node placement are significant, and periodic adjustments (swaps) can lead to better solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by tracking improvements in cut value over successive iterations and comparing the impact of different scaling factors and swap frequencies.

4. **greedy_swap_5bb5()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when a quick, greedy improvement is needed, especially in dense graphs where many potential swaps could quickly lead to better cuts.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by the number of successful swaps leading to improved cut values and the rate of convergence.

5. **highest_delta_edge_9f66()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in scenarios where specific edge additions can significantly affect the cut, making it applicable in graphs with distinct critical edges.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by comparing the increase in cut weight per edge addition and the number of iterations needed to stabilize the solution.

6. **highest_delta_node_b31b()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best for cases where individual node decisions have a significant impact, particularly in graphs with uneven node connectivity.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by the change in cut weight per node addition and the overall improvement in cut value.

7. **multi_swap_2_dbfe()**:
   - **Scenario**: Optimal for dense graphs where individual swaps might be insufficient, and a combination of swaps can provide better solutions.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by the improvement in cut value from simultaneous swaps and computational efficiency in dense graphs.

8. **random_5c59()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable as a baseline or in highly exploratory phases of the problem-solving process, where randomness can help escape local optima.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by the diversity of solutions generated and the occasional discovery of high-quality solutions.

9. **simulated_annealing_ed14()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for large, complex graphs where escaping local optima is critical, benefiting from its probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions initially.
   - **Quantification**: Quantified by the rate of acceptance of worse solutions over time and the final cut value relative to initial solutions.

Each heuristic can be adapted and tested against specific instances of the MaxCut problem to determine their effectiveness in various scenarios, often requiring empirical analysis to refine their applicability.

Before this discuss, we have already 5 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: random_5c59
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Given that the initial state has no nodes selected and no edges cut, starting with a random insertion heuristic can help explore the solution space quickly. This approach will provide a diverse range of initial solutions that can be refined with more targeted heuristics in subsequent steps.
Delta of Selected Node: 100
Delta of Cut Value: 150.0
---Round 1---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic is chosen to leverage the existing balance while focusing on improving the cut value through iterative swaps. Given the sparse nature of the graph, this approach could efficiently enhance the solution quality.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 68.0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the cut value in the previous round. Given the current state, with a relatively balanced partition and a significant portion of nodes already selected, continuing with this heuristic can further optimize the cut value by exploring additional swap opportunities. Running it for another 200 steps will allow for a more thorough exploration of potential improvements.
Delta of Selected Node: 0
Delta of Cut Value: 0.0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: Given the current state where the greedy_swap_5bb5 heuristic has plateaued, employing the most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic can provide a fresh perspective by considering both immediate and future impacts of node placement. Additionally, its periodic swap mechanism can further explore potential improvements in the cut value, leveraging the already balanced partition and selected nodes. Running it for 200 steps allows for sufficient exploration and potential enhancement of the solution.
Delta of Selected Node: 160
Delta of Cut Value: 1380.0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 200
Explain: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has shown significant improvement in the previous round, with a substantial increase in both the number of selected nodes and the cut value. Given its ability to consider both immediate and future impacts of node placement and the periodic swap mechanism, it is beneficial to continue utilizing it for further optimization. Running it for an additional 200 steps will allow for deeper exploration and potential enhancement of the solution, especially given the current state with a balanced partition and a notable number of unselected nodes remaining.
Delta of Selected Node: 160
Delta of Cut Value: 2268.0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: most_weight_neighbors_d31b. How does most_weight_neighbors_d31b perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
Since a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b
running steps: 200
hype parameter(optional): scaling_factor=0.5;swap_frequency=5
explanation: The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic has demonstrated significant improvements in the cut value over the last two rounds, indicating its effectiveness in the current problem state. Given the balanced partition and the substantial number of unselected nodes remaining, continuing with this heuristic for another 200 steps is likely to yield further enhancements in the cut value. The periodic swap mechanism and consideration of both immediate and future impacts make it well-suited to continue refining the solution.
