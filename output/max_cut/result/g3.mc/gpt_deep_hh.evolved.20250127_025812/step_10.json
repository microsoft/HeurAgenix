The node is then inserted into that set which maximizes the cut weight.\n\nBalance: These heuristics aim to maintain or achieve a balanced partition while optimizing the cut value.\ndef balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.\ndef most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.\n\nSwap-based: These heuristics focus on swapping nodes between sets to improve the cut value.\ndef greedy_swap_5bb5(): Greedy Swap Heuristic for the Max Cut problem. Iteratively evaluates the delta in cut value for all possible single-node swaps between set A and set B, and performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value. If no swap improves the cut value, no operator is returned.\ndef multi_swap_2_dbfe(): This heuristic evaluates all possible pairs of nodes for swapping between set A and set B. It performs the swap that leads to the highest increase in the cut value, considering the combined effect of swapping two nodes simultaneously rather than one at a time. It utilizes numpy operations for efficient computation.\n\nFuture Impact: These heuristics consider both immediate and future impacts of node insertion for more strategic decision-making.\ndef balanced_cut_c0e6(): Balanced Cut heuristic for the Max Cut problem with improvements to ensure balanced partitions, future impact consideration, and periodic swap operations.\ndef most_weight_neighbors_d31b(scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5): The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.\n\nSimulated Annealing: This heuristic uses probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to escape local optima and explore the solution space.\ndef simulated_annealing_ed14(): Simulated Annealing heuristic for the Max Cut problem.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

                "text": "To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for solving the MaxCut problem using the provided heuristics, we can break down the approach into two main phases: Construction Phase and Improvement Phase. Each phase will have specific steps and considerations for selecting the appropriate heuristic categories. Here's a framework to guide the process:\n\n### Construction Phase\nThe goal in this phase is to build an initial feasible solution. Start with heuristics that quickly generate a solution, even if it's not optimal.\n\n1. **Initial Solution Construction**\n   - **Greedy Heuristics**: Begin with greedy heuristics like `highest_weight_edge_ca02` and `highest_delta_node_b31b` to quickly construct an initial solution by focusing on immediate gains.\n   - Execution Step: Run each greedy heuristic briefly, observe the cut value increase, and select the one that provides the best initial improvement.\n\n2. **Balancing the Partition**\n   - **Balance Heuristics**: Once an initial solution is constructed, use `balanced_cut_c0e6` or `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to ensure the partition is balanced while maintaining or improving the cut value.\n   - Execution Step: Alternate between balance heuristics to maintain equal sizes of sets A and B.\n\n### Improvement Phase\nIn this phase, the focus is on refining and improving the initial solution iteratively.\n\n1. **Exploration and Refinement**\n   - **Swap-based Heuristics**: Use `greedy_swap_5bb5` and `multi_swap_2_dbfe` to explore the solution space by swapping nodes between sets. This can help in escaping local optima and refining the cut value.\n   - Execution Step: Evaluate swaps iteratively, perform those that improve the cut, and track improvements over iterations.\n\n2. **Strategic Adjustments**\n   - **Future Impact Heuristics**: Incorporate `most_weight_neighbors_d31b` to consider future impacts and possible benefits of node placement.\n   - Execution Step: Periodically integrate future impact heuristics to reassess and adjust node positions, aiming for strategic long-term gains.\n\n3. **Escaping Local Optima**\n   - **Simulated Annealing**: Introduce `simulated_annealing_ed14` to probabilistically accept worse solutions, allowing exploration of the solution space and escape from local optima.\n   - Execution Step: Apply simulated annealing with a cooling schedule, enabling the acceptance of suboptimal moves initially and gradually reducing this probability.\n\n### Iterative Process\n- **Performance Evaluation**: After each heuristic run, evaluate the solution's performance. If improvements plateau, switch categories or heuristics to explore new opportunities.\n- **Alternation**: Alternately cycle through different heuristics, adjusting based on observed effectiveness and solution quality.\n\n### General Considerations\n- **Experimentation**: The framework encourages experimentation with various heuristics to find effective combinations.\n- **Adaptation**: Be flexible and ready to adjust the strategy based on performance metrics and solution quality.\n\nBy following this strategic guide, you can systematically explore and refine solutions for the MaxCut problem, leveraging the diverse set of heuristics available."

                "text": "Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:\nnode_num:800\naverage_node_degree:47.94\nedge_density:0.06\naverage_edge_weight:1.0\nmax_edge_weight:1.0\nmin_edge_weight:1.0\nstandard_deviation_edge_weight:0.0\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nBefore this discuss, we have already 10 rounds discuss and the summary are:\n---Round 0---\nHeuristic: highest_weight_edge_ca02\nHeuristic Category: Greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Since the current solution has no nodes in either set (set_a and set_b are empty), it's essential to construct an initial solution from scratch. Starting with a Greedy approach will allow for a rapid and straightforward construction of an initial solution by maximizing immediate gains, which is suitable given that no nodes have been selected yet.\nSelected Node: 0->1\nCut Value: 0->0\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: Greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  The current solution has just begun with only one node placed in set A and none in set B, resulting in no edges contributing to the cut value. Continuing with the Greedy category will allow further rapid construction of the initial solution by adding more nodes and potentially increasing the cut value quickly. Given that the imbalance is minimal and the solution is in its early stages, a Greedy approach remains suitable for quickly populating the sets and evaluating immediate gains.\nSelected Node: 1->2\nCut Value: 0->1.0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: highest_delta_node_b31b\nHeuristic Category: Greedy\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the early stage of the solution development with only two nodes placed and a minimal cut value, continuing with the Greedy category will allow for rapid expansion of the solution. The goal is to quickly populate the sets with additional nodes, which can help identify potential edges that contribute to the cut value. Since the imbalance ratio is 0.0 and the selected nodes ratio is very low, there is room to explore more greedy choices that could quickly increase the cut value and enhance the initial construction. This approach is suitable for building a solid foundation before transitioning to more complex heuristics.\nSelected Node: 2->3\nCut Value: 1.0->2.0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: Balance\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, with a minimal imbalance ratio and a low selected nodes ratio, it is beneficial to aim for a more balanced partition while continuing to build on the initial solution. Switching to the Balance category will help maintain or achieve a balanced partition as more nodes are added, which can lead to better utilization of available nodes and potentially improve the cut value. This approach will lay a strong foundation for further exploration and improvement in subsequent phases.\nSelected Node: 3->3\nCut Value: 2.0->1.0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: greedy_swap_5bb5\nHeuristic Category: Swap-based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution with a low cut value and a small number of selected nodes, it would be beneficial to explore swap-based heuristics to refine the partition and potentially increase the cut value. Swap-based heuristics can help in adjusting the placement of nodes between sets A and B, thereby improving the cut value without adding new nodes immediately. This approach allows for better exploration of the solution space and can complement the initial greedy and balance strategies by focusing on optimizing the existing structure.\nSelected Node: 3->3\nCut Value: 1.0->2.0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe\nHeuristic Category: Swap-based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution state indicates a low cut value and a small number of selected nodes, suggesting there is still room for improvement. The recent application of the swap-based heuristic `greedy_swap_5bb5` resulted in an increase in the cut value, indicating that swaps are effectively optimizing the partition. Continuing with Swap-based heuristics can further refine the partition, as they allow for exploring different configurations without immediately adding new nodes. This approach can help in maximizing the current cut value by making more effective adjustments to the existing node placements.\nSelected Node: 3->3\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: most_weight_neighbors_d31b\nHeuristic Category: Future Impact\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution shows a small number of selected nodes and a low cut value, indicating that there is still significant room for improvement. Although swap-based heuristics have been used, the cut value has not significantly increased in the last step, suggesting a potential plateau in their effectiveness at this stage. Switching to the Future Impact category can help in making more strategic decisions by considering both immediate and future impacts of node placements. This approach could lead to identifying configurations that offer better long-term gains, thus enhancing the cut value more effectively than relying solely on immediate swaps.\nSelected Node: 3->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: simulated_annealing_ed14\nHeuristic Category: Simulated Annealing\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state of the solution, with a small number of selected nodes, low cut value, and a potential plateau in improvement using the recent Future Impact heuristic, exploring the Simulated Annealing category could be beneficial. Simulated Annealing can help escape local optima by probabilistically accepting worse solutions, which might lead to discovering better configurations. This approach allows for exploring the solution space more broadly and can complement previous strategies by injecting randomness and controlled exploration.\nSelected Node: 4->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: multi_swap_2_dbfe\nHeuristic Category: Swap-based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: Given the current state of the solution, the cut value has plateaued at 2.0, and the simulated annealing approach did not yield an improvement. The selected nodes and imbalance ratio indicate that there is still significant room for improvement. Returning to the Swap-based category could help refine the partition further by exploring different configurations of node placements between sets A and B. Swap-based heuristics have previously shown potential for increasing the cut value by optimizing existing node placements, and they can help escape the current plateau by adjusting the partition without adding new nodes.\nSelected Node: 4->4\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: balanced_cut_c0e6\nHeuristic Category: Future Impact\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain: The current solution has reached a plateau with a low cut value and a small number of selected nodes. The recent Swap-based heuristic did not lead to an improvement in the cut value. Given the minimal imbalance and the low selected nodes ratio, switching to the Future Impact category could offer strategic insights by considering both immediate and future impacts of node placements. This approach can help identify configurations that enhance the cut value more effectively than immediate swaps, potentially leading to long-term gains and breaking the current plateau.\nSelected Node: 4->5\nCut Value: 2.0->2.0\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nset_a: 40,0,595,263\nset_b: 23\n\nset_a_count:4\nset_b_count:1\nselected_nodes:{0, 263, 40, 595, 23}\nselected_num:5\nunselected_num:795\ncurrent_cut_value:2.0\nimbalance_ratio:0.00375\ncut_value:2.0\naverage_cut_edge_weight:0.4\nselected_nodes_ratio:0.00625\nunselected_nodes_ratio:0.99375\nedge_weight_variance_within_sets:0.0\nboundary_node_ratio:0.00625\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: balanced_cut_c0e6(Future Impact). How it works?\nShould me:\n- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or\n- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nWe intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: Greedy,Balance,Swap-based,Future Impact,Simulated Annealing\n\nThe response format is very important.\n1.
