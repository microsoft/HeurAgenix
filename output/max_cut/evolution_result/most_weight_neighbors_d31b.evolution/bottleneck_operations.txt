I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on max_cut problem:
MaxCut is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two sets is maximized.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the MaxCut problem.
Two sets of vertices representing the partition of the graph into two subsets."""
    def __init__(self, set_a: set[int], set_b: set[int]):
        self.set_a = set_a
        self.set_b = set_b
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class InsertNodeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert a node into one of the sets for the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int, target_set: str):
        self.node = node
        self.target_set = target_set
        assert target_set in ['A', 'B']
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.target_set == 'A':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_b
            new_set_a.add(self.node)
        elif self.target_set == 'B':
            assert self.node not in solution.set_a
            new_set_b.add(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class InsertEdgeOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Insert an edge into the MaxCut solution with node_1 in set A and node_2 in set B."""
    def __init__(self, node_1: int, node_2: int):
        self.node_1 = node_1
        self.node_2 = node_2
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        assert self.node_1 not in solution.set_b
        assert self.node_2 not in solution.set_a
        new_set_a.add(self.node_1)
        new_set_b.add(self.node_2)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class SwapOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Swap a list of nodes from origin set to the opposite set in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[int]):
        self.nodes = nodes
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if node in solution.set_a:
                assert node not in solution.set_b
                new_set_a.remove(node)
                new_set_b.add(node)
            elif node in solution.set_b:
                assert node not in solution.set_a
                new_set_b.remove(node)
                new_set_a.add(node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)
class DeleteOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Delete a node from both sets in the MaxCut solution."""
    def __init__(self, node: int):
        self.node = node
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_set_a = set(solution.set_a)
        new_set_b = set(solution.set_b)
        if self.node in solution.set_a:
            new_set_a.remove(self.node)
        elif self.node in solution.set_b:
            new_set_b.remove(self.node)
        return Solution(new_set_a, new_set_b)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: call, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "node_num" (int): The total number of vertices in the graph.
    - "weight_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the weight between nodes.
state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "set_a_count" (int): The number of nodes in set A of the current partition.
    - "set_b_count" (int): The number of nodes in set B of the current partition.
    - "selected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of selected nodes.
    - "selected_num" (int): The number of nodes have been selected.
    - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of unselected nodes.
    - "unselected_num" (int): The number of nodes have not been selected.
    - "current_cut_value" (int or float): The total weight of edges between set A and set B in the current solution.
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
get_state_data_function(callable): The get_state_data_function is the function that receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution. It will not modify the origin solution.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is max_cut a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

In this instance, I have developed a heuristic function, although its performance has not reached a satisfactory level. My goal is to learn from case studies to improve and optimize this heuristic. To achieve this, I will provide the following:
1. The heuristic function code.
2. Test data for evaluation.
3. Negative solution from heuristic function.

def most_weight_neighbors_d31b(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: callable, scaling_factor: float = 0.5, swap_frequency: int = 5, **kwargs) -> tuple[InsertNodeOperator, dict]:
    """The most_weight_neighbors_d31b heuristic selects an unselected node based on both immediate and future impacts 
    on the cut value and periodically considers swaps to further improve the solution.

    Args:

            - "current_solution" (Solution): The current partition of the graph into sets A and B.
            - "unselected_nodes" (set[int]): The set of nodes that have not yet been selected.
            - "current_cut_value" (float): The current cut value of the solution.
        algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for the current algorithm only. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "sorted_nodes" (list of tuples): A sorted list of (node, future_impact) in descending order.
            - "operation_count" (int): The number of operations performed so far.
        get_state_data_function (callable): The function receives the new solution as input and returns the state dictionary for the new solution. It does not modify the original solution.
        scaling_factor (float, optional): A hyperparameter to scale the future impact of nodes. Defaults to 0.5.
        swap_frequency (int, optional): Frequency (in terms of operations) at which swap operations are considered. Defaults to 5.

    Returns:
        InsertNodeOperator or SwapOperator: The operator to modify the solution.

Please based on the data and solution, help to pick out the bottleneck operations in negative solution, which may cause the poor performance
Please note:
1. Some operations, although they appear different, are essentially the same.
2. Some operations may lead to solutions that look different but are essentially the same.
3. Some operations may cause changes to the solution but do not affect the final cost; these are not considered bottlenecks.
4. When an operation A is performed poorly, leading to a series of subsequent operations experiencing issues, we consider the first operation A to be a bottleneck.
5. If there is only one item, there is no need to force multiple answers.
6. Try to propose a better operator than origin one and you can learn from positive solution or others.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***bottleneck_operations:

***bottleneck_operations:
3; InsertNodeOperator(node=4, target_set='B'); The node 4 should have been placed in set B to increase the cut value, as seen in the positive solution.
5; None; The swap operation did not improve the cut value as intended, indicating a prior misplacement of nodes.
