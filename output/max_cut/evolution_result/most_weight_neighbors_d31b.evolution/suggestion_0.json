Is this suggestion clear and achievable? For example, choosing operation A brings greater benefits in the form of rebates is not a clear and achievable suggestion because we do not know how to measure future benefits.\n2. Will the updated suggestion make the function output  InsertNodeOperator(node=4, target_set='B') in this step?\n3. If we run the updated function on this data from beginning to end, will the result be better than set_a: 0,3,4\nset_b: 1,2 (2.0)?\n4. Is this a commonly useful update for all instances or states?\n\nThe response format is very important.
