                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines.

                "text": "Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable and how the scenarios could be best quantified:\n\n### 1. **`exchange_production_orders_eda2`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best applied when there is a need to optimize the internal sequence of orders within production lines or between lines. It is particularly useful when the current schedule has inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequencing, especially when non-adjacent swaps could significantly reduce transition times or improve order fulfillment.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)`).\n     - High total transition time across production lines (`sum(transition_time)`).\n     - High variance in production line utilization (`np.var(total_time_cost_per_production_line)`).\n     - Low overall order fulfillment rate (`fulfilled_order_num / order_num`).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where orders need to be prioritized based on their contribution to maximizing overall fulfillment. It works well in dynamic environments where new orders with tight deadlines or higher priorities are added, and the production schedule needs to adapt.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High density of orders with tight deadlines (`np.mean(order_deadline) - np.min(order_deadline)`).\n     - Large number of orders in the backlog (`len(unfulfilled_orders)`).\n     - High variability in order sizes (`np.var(order_quantity)`).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when prioritization needs to focus on orders that are closest to their deadlines and have a high probability of being completed on time. It is particularly effective in scenarios where most orders have a relatively short time window for completion.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - Small average remaining time to deadlines (`np.mean(order_deadline - current_time)`).\n     - High number of orders with imminent deadlines (`sum(order_deadline - current_time < threshold)`).\n     - High ratio of unfulfilled orders with imminent deadlines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if order_deadline[o] - current_time < threshold]) / len(unfulfilled_orders)`).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when balancing the workload across production lines can improve overall efficiency. It is especially useful when one or more production lines are overburdened while others are underutilized, or when unfulfilled orders can be feasibly shifted to other lines.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High imbalance in production line utilization (`np.std(total_time_cost_per_production_line)`).\n     - Large number of unfulfilled orders with feasible alternative production lines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if any(v_ip != 0 for v_ip in production_rate[:, order_product[o]])])`).\n     - High number of orders nearing deadlines on overburdened lines (`sum([order_deadline[o] - current_time < threshold for o in production_schedule[overburdened_line]])`).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in scenarios where there is a need to greedily maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on smaller, simpler orders that can be completed quickly. It is useful in environments where many orders have varying production times and deadlines, and shorter operations can free up capacity for other orders.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High ratio of small orders with tight deadlines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if order_quantity[o] < small_order_threshold and order_deadline[o] - current_time < tight_deadline_threshold]) / len(unfulfilled_orders)`).\n     - High number of feasible orders with small production times (`len(feasible_orders_to_fulfill)`).\n     - High average transition time compared to average production time (`np.mean(transition_time) / np.mean(production_rate)`).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best suited for scenarios where suboptimal order sequences within production lines result in high transition times or unfulfilled orders. It is particularly effective in fine-tuning schedules that are already valid but can be improved by reducing inefficiencies.\n   - **Quantification**:\n     - High total transition time within production lines (`sum([sum(transition_time[i]) for i in range(production_line_num)])`).\n     - High number of consecutive unfulfilled orders within a single production line (`len([segment for segment in production_schedule if not validation_single_production_schedule(segment)])`).\n     - Low overall schedule efficiency compared to potential maximum (`fulfilled_order_num / order_num`).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Best Quantifiers for Each Heuristic\n| **Heuristic**                       | **Best Quantifiers**                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `exchange_production_orders_eda2`   | Unfulfilled orders, high total transition time, high variance in production line utilization, low order fulfillment rate               |\n| `greedy_by_order_density_de77`      | Tight deadlines, large backlog, high variability in order sizes                                                                        |\n| `least_order_remaining_27ca`        | Imminent deadlines, small remaining time to deadlines, high ratio of unfulfilled orders with tight deadlines                          |\n| `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`    | Imbalanced production line utilization, feasibility of shifting orders, overburdened lines with imminent deadlines                    |\n| `shortest_operation_ae31`           | Small orders with tight deadlines, feasible small orders, high average transition-to-production time ratio                             |\n| `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`    | High transition time, consecutive unfulfilled orders within lines, low schedule efficiency                                             |\n\nBy using these quantifiers, you can determine which heuristic is most applicable to a given scenario in DPOSP and apply the one that is most likely to yield the best results."
