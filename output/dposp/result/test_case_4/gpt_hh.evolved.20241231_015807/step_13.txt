I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable and how the scenarios could be best quantified:

### 1. **`exchange_production_orders_eda2`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best applied when there is a need to optimize the internal sequence of orders within production lines or between lines. It is particularly useful when the current schedule has inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequencing, especially when non-adjacent swaps could significantly reduce transition times or improve order fulfillment.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)`).
     - High total transition time across production lines (`sum(transition_time)`).
     - High variance in production line utilization (`np.var(total_time_cost_per_production_line)`).
     - Low overall order fulfillment rate (`fulfilled_order_num / order_num`).

---

### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where orders need to be prioritized based on their contribution to maximizing overall fulfillment. It works well in dynamic environments where new orders with tight deadlines or higher priorities are added, and the production schedule needs to adapt.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High density of orders with tight deadlines (`np.mean(order_deadline) - np.min(order_deadline)`).
     - Large number of orders in the backlog (`len(unfulfilled_orders)`).
     - High variability in order sizes (`np.var(order_quantity)`).

---

### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when prioritization needs to focus on orders that are closest to their deadlines and have a high probability of being completed on time. It is particularly effective in scenarios where most orders have a relatively short time window for completion.
   - **Quantification**:
     - Small average remaining time to deadlines (`np.mean(order_deadline - current_time)`).
     - High number of orders with imminent deadlines (`sum(order_deadline - current_time < threshold)`).
     - High ratio of unfulfilled orders with imminent deadlines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if order_deadline[o] - current_time < threshold]) / len(unfulfilled_orders)`).

---

### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when balancing the workload across production lines can improve overall efficiency. It is especially useful when one or more production lines are overburdened while others are underutilized, or when unfulfilled orders can be feasibly shifted to other lines.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High imbalance in production line utilization (`np.std(total_time_cost_per_production_line)`).
     - Large number of unfulfilled orders with feasible alternative production lines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if any(v_ip != 0 for v_ip in production_rate[:, order_product[o]])])`).
     - High number of orders nearing deadlines on overburdened lines (`sum([order_deadline[o] - current_time < threshold for o in production_schedule[overburdened_line]])`).

---

### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective in scenarios where there is a need to greedily maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on smaller, simpler orders that can be completed quickly. It is useful in environments where many orders have varying production times and deadlines, and shorter operations can free up capacity for other orders.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High ratio of small orders with tight deadlines (`len([o for o in unfulfilled_orders if order_quantity[o] < small_order_threshold and order_deadline[o] - current_time < tight_deadline_threshold]) / len(unfulfilled_orders)`).
     - High number of feasible orders with small production times (`len(feasible_orders_to_fulfill)`).
     - High average transition time compared to average production time (`np.mean(transition_time) / np.mean(production_rate)`).

---

### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is best suited for scenarios where suboptimal order sequences within production lines result in high transition times or unfulfilled orders. It is particularly effective in fine-tuning schedules that are already valid but can be improved by reducing inefficiencies.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High total transition time within production lines (`sum([sum(transition_time[i]) for i in range(production_line_num)])`).
     - High number of consecutive unfulfilled orders within a single production line (`len([segment for segment in production_schedule if not validation_single_production_schedule(segment)])`).
     - Low overall schedule efficiency compared to potential maximum (`fulfilled_order_num / order_num`).

---

### Summary of Best Quantifiers for Each Heuristic
| **Heuristic**                       | **Best Quantifiers**                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `exchange_production_orders_eda2`   | Unfulfilled orders, high total transition time, high variance in production line utilization, low order fulfillment rate               |
| `greedy_by_order_density_de77`      | Tight deadlines, large backlog, high variability in order sizes                                                                        |
| `least_order_remaining_27ca`        | Imminent deadlines, small remaining time to deadlines, high ratio of unfulfilled orders with tight deadlines                          |
| `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`    | Imbalanced production line utilization, feasibility of shifting orders, overburdened lines with imminent deadlines                    |
| `shortest_operation_ae31`           | Small orders with tight deadlines, feasible small orders, high average transition-to-production time ratio                             |
| `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`    | High transition time, consecutive unfulfilled orders within lines, low schedule efficiency                                             |

By using these quantifiers, you can determine which heuristic is most applicable to a given scenario in DPOSP and apply the one that is most likely to yield the best results.

Before this discuss, we have already 13 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The initial state shows that all orders are unfulfilled, and the feasible orders to fulfill count is relatively high (81). Given the absence of any schedule yet, prioritizing orders with tight deadlines, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling is crucial. The `greedy_by_order_density_de77` heuristic is well-suited for this scenario, as it can quickly build a baseline solution by addressing the most critical orders first.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 13.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -414
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The current fulfillment ratio is very low (0.1), and there is significant imbalance in the utilization of production lines (some lines have high time costs while others are idle). Additionally, there are many unfulfilled orders (2207 total quantity) and a moderate number of feasible orders to fulfill (71). Shifting orders between lines can help balance the workload and potentially fulfill more orders without exceeding deadlines. Running 5 steps will allow us to explore improvements without overcommitting to this heuristic.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The fulfillment ratio is still low at 0.1, and a large number of unfulfilled orders remain (2207 total quantity). While the total time cost per production line is relatively balanced after previous adjustments (no delta in time cost), the current schedule may still suffer from inefficiencies in sequencing, as indicated by the low number of fulfilled orders and high unfulfilled order quantity. Using `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` can help refine the production sequence within each production line, reducing transition times and improving the overall schedule efficiency. Running 10 steps will allow us to explore improvements in this direction without overcommitting resources.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current fulfillment ratio remains low (0.1), and the total time cost per production line has not improved significantly. While previous runs of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` did not produce immediate improvements, this heuristic remains valuable for refining production sequences within lines. Given the high unfulfilled order quantity (2207) and the potential for reducing transition inefficiencies, running another 10 steps may uncover better sequences. This avoids prematurely switching to another heuristic while still allowing time for optimization in this direction.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Despite no observed improvement in the previous rounds, the current state still indicates inefficiencies in sequencing, as evidenced by the low fulfillment ratio (0.1) and the high unfulfilled order quantity (2207). `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` is designed to refine the internal sequencing of production lines, reducing transition times and improving order fulfillment. Running another 10 steps allows us to further explore these potential improvements while ensuring we do not prematurely switch to a different heuristic.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous runs of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` have not shown immediate improvements in terms of fulfilled orders or time cost, but the scenario still indicates inefficiencies in sequencing. The fulfillment ratio remains low at 0.1, and the unfulfilled order quantity is high (2207). Since this heuristic is specifically designed to refine the internal sequencing of production lines and reduce transition inefficiencies, continuing with 10 more steps allows further exploration of potential improvements without prematurely switching to another heuristic. Furthermore, the absence of improvements so far may suggest that additional iterations are needed to navigate the solution space effectively.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 6---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows a low fulfillment ratio (0.1) and a large number of unfulfilled orders (2207 total quantity). Despite multiple rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`, no improvements were observed in fulfilled order count or time cost. This suggests that refining sequences alone is insufficient to address the problem. Instead, a heuristic that prioritizes orders based on their density (tight deadlines, feasibility, and flexibility) can help inject new orders into the schedule effectively. Running 10 steps of `greedy_by_order_density_de77` will allow us to constructively build upon the current solution by addressing the most critical orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -787
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 7---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current state shows improvement in fulfilled orders after applying `greedy_by_order_density_de77` in Round 6 (+10 fulfilled orders), indicating its effectiveness in prioritizing critical orders. However, the fulfillment ratio is still low (0.2), and there remains a significant number of unfulfilled orders (2151 total quantity). Given the recent success of this heuristic, continuing with another 10 steps will allow further prioritization of feasible orders with tight deadlines and high potential for fulfillment. This approach ensures we capitalize on the momentum gained while assessing its diminishing returns.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 26.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -699
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 8---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The recent application of `greedy_by_order_density_de77` in Rounds 6 and 7 demonstrated incremental improvements, with +10 fulfilled orders per round. Although the fulfillment ratio has increased to 0.3, it remains relatively low, and the unfulfilled order quantity is still substantial (2020). Given its effectiveness in prioritizing critical orders and the presence of 38 feasible orders to fulfill, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical progression to further capitalize on its momentum and address the most critical unfulfilled orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 29.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -831
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 9---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous rounds of `greedy_by_order_density_de77` have consistently yielded improvements in the fulfilled order count (+10 per round), increasing the fulfillment ratio from 0.1 to 0.4. However, the fulfillment ratio is still relatively low, and there remains a significant number of unfulfilled orders (1850 total quantity). Given the presence of 19 feasible orders to fulfill, continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps is a logical progression to further address critical unfulfilled orders with tight deadlines and high potential for fulfillment. This ensures we capitalize on its demonstrated effectiveness while assessing diminishing returns.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 71.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1161
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 10---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The recent rounds of `greedy_by_order_density_de77` have consistently demonstrated incremental improvements in fulfilled orders (+10 per round), raising the fulfillment ratio from 0.1 to 0.5. However, there are still 50 unfulfilled orders with a total quantity of 1436, and the feasible order count is low (1). This suggests diminishing returns but not complete saturation. Running another 10 steps of this heuristic will allow us to further explore its impact while monitoring for signs of performance plateau. Given its prior effectiveness, this is a logical continuation to address remaining critical unfulfilled orders with tight deadlines and high potential for fulfillment.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 11---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current fulfillment ratio is at 0.5, with 50 unfulfilled orders remaining and a significant total unfulfilled quantity of 1436. While `greedy_by_order_density_de77` has demonstrated effectiveness in prior rounds, its performance has plateaued in the last round, showing no further improvement. Given the current state, `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` is a suitable choice to refine the sequencing of production orders within lines to reduce transition inefficiencies and optimize the schedule. This heuristic is particularly well-suited for the current scenario, where the feasible orders to fulfill count is low (1), and improvements may depend on better sequencing rather than inserting new orders. Running 10 steps will allow us to explore potential improvements in order sequencing without overcommitting resources.

---Round 12---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The current fulfillment ratio is at 0.5, with 50 unfulfilled orders and a total unfulfilled quantity of 1436. The feasible orders to fulfill count is very low (1), indicating that the current schedule's inefficiencies may stem from suboptimal order sequencing rather than the addition of new orders. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` is specifically designed to refine production sequences within lines by reducing transition inefficiencies and optimizing the schedule. Given its applicability to the current scenario and prior rounds' observed plateau in performance, running another 10 steps of this heuristic allows further exploration of potential sequencing improvements without overcommitting resources.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
