                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP.

The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines.

Here's a breakdown of potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is best suited for scenarios where the existing schedule can be significantly improved by reordering tasks. If the production schedule has inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequences, this heuristic can explore alternative sequences by swapping orders.\n   - **Quantification**: Look for scenarios with high production line utilization and frequent transitions, where minimizing transition times can lead to notable efficiency gains.\n\n2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is applicable in scenarios where orders differ significantly in terms of deadlines and production feasibility. It is useful when a quick decision is needed about which orders to prioritize based on a combination of factors like tight deadlines and machine availability.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for scenarios with a mix of urgent and less urgent orders, allowing for prioritization based on a weighted score.\n\n3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is effective when there is potential to rearrange order sequences on a production line to better meet deadlines and reduce transition costs. It excels in scenarios where production lines are capable of producing multiple products with varying speeds.\n   - **Quantification**: Suitable for scenarios with long order sequences on production lines where minor adjustments can lead to improved efficiency.\n\n4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is beneficial in scenarios where minimizing individual order production times can significantly impact overall schedule efficiency. It is well-suited for environments with strict deadlines and varying order sizes.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable when there's a high volume of orders with varying durations, and time optimization is crucial to maximize fulfilled orders.\n\n5. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic works well in scenarios where the aim is to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before reaching capacity limits. It focuses on orders that can be completed quickly or have the nearest deadlines.\n   - **Quantification**: Best used when the production lines are nearing capacity, and prioritization is necessary to maximize output.\n\n6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:\n   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This heuristic is applicable when there is an imbalance in production line workloads, or specific orders are better suited to different production lines due to varying machine capabilities.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for scenarios with underutilized production lines or when certain orders are delayed on current lines but can be fulfilled on others.\n\nIn summary, each heuristic targets specific inefficiencies or characteristics within the DPOSP framework, and their applicability is determined by the nature of the production environment, order characteristics, and machine capabilities. By analyzing the production constraints and objectives, you can select the most suitable heuristic for a given scenario."

How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
