I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

DPOSP, as described, is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of production actions across multiple production lines to maximize the number of completed orders before their deadlines. The problem's combinatorial nature arises from the necessity to explore different permutations of order scheduling across various production lines, considering constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. Heuristic methods are well-suited for this type of problem because they can efficiently search through large solution spaces and provide good approximate solutions within reasonable time frames. The framework with different operators and solution representations you've built aligns well with heuristic approaches to tackle such combinatorial optimization challenges.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): deadline_sensitive,sequence_optimization,load_balancing,flexibility_and_feasibility

deadline_sensitive: These heuristics prioritize orders based on deadline proximity and feasibility, aiming to maximize the number of orders completed on time.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

sequence_optimization: These heuristics focus on optimizing the sequence of orders to improve schedule efficiency, often by swapping or reversing segments.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.

load_balancing: This heuristic attempts to balance the load across production lines by shifting orders between them.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

flexibility_and_feasibility: These heuristics consider future scheduling flexibility and feasibility when prioritizing orders, aiming to maintain an adaptable production schedule.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Creating a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps is crucial for effectively solving the DPOSP. Hereâs a proposed framework that can help in systematically approaching the problem by alternating between various heuristic strategies during the construction and improvement phases:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution

#### Phase 1: Initialization
- **Objective:** Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.
- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Construction Heuristics
  - **Execution Steps:**
    1. **Deadline-Sensitive Heuristics:** Start with `greedy_by_order_density_de77` to quickly prioritize orders that are most urgent and feasible based on deadlines.
    2. **Flexibility and Feasibility Heuristics:** Use `least_order_remaining_27ca` to refine the initial solution by considering future scheduling flexibility and feasibility.
  - **Evaluation:** Check if the initial solution meets basic feasibility and deadline constraints. If not, iterate within these heuristics to adjust parameters.

#### Phase 2: Construction
- **Objective:** Build upon the initial solution to construct a more robust schedule.
- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Deadline-Sensitive and Load Balancing
  - **Execution Steps:**
    1. **Deadline-Sensitive:** Continue using `shortest_operation_ae31` for optimizing the sequence based on deadlines and feasibility.
    2. **Load Balancing:** Introduce `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to distribute the workload evenly across production lines, improving overall efficiency.
  - **Evaluation:** After each heuristic application, assess the number of fulfilled orders and balance across lines. Adjust strategies based on performance metrics.

#### Phase 3: Improvement
- **Objective:** Optimize the existing schedule by enhancing efficiency and reducing production times.
- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Sequence Optimization and Flexibility and Feasibility
  - **Execution Steps:**
    1. **Sequence Optimization:** Apply `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and `exchange_production_orders_eda2` to optimize the order sequence, focusing on reducing transition times and enhancing schedule efficiency.
    2. **Flexibility and Feasibility:** Revisit `greedy_by_order_density_de77` and `least_order_remaining_27ca` to ensure the schedule remains adaptable to potential changes.
  - **Evaluation:** Evaluate improvements in terms of reduced total time and increased order completion. Iterate between sequence optimization and flexibility strategies.

#### Phase 4: Iteration and Adaptation
- **Objective:** Continuously refine the schedule based on performance feedback.
- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Adaptation and Iteration
  - **Execution Steps:**
    1. Continuously alternate between different heuristics from the above categories, adjusting parameters based on the solutionâs current state and performance metrics.
    2. Periodically reassess which heuristics are providing the most benefit and adapt the strategy accordingly.
  - **Evaluation:** Regularly assess performance metrics such as total fulfilled orders, production line utilization, and adherence to deadlines. Use this data to inform future heuristic selections.

### Key Considerations:
- **Avoid Over-Reliance on a Single Heuristic:** Regularly switch between different heuristics to prevent local optima and explore diverse solution landscapes.
- **Iterative Testing and Evaluation:** Implement a feedback loop where the results of each heuristic application inform the next steps.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Continuously adjust heuristic parameters based on observed performance to optimize their effectiveness.

This strategic guide serves as a flexible framework to navigate through the DPOSP by leveraging a diverse set of heuristics, ensuring both the construction and improvement phases are effectively managed.

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Since no orders have been fulfilled yet and the initial solution is essentially empty, it is crucial to start building a foundation for the solution by focusing on fulfilling orders with the tightest deadlines. The deadline_sensitive category will help prioritize orders that are most urgent, allowing us to establish a baseline solution. By doing so, we can quickly fill in the production lines with feasible orders that need immediate attention, thereby increasing the fulfillment ratio and making further improvements easier.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->1.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3940->3923
Fulfilled Order Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Given the current state where only one order has been fulfilled, it seems the initial foundation has been set but requires further development. The deadline-sensitive category remains a strategic choice to quickly increase the fulfillment ratio by continuing to prioritize orders with tight deadlines. This approach will help in building momentum by increasing the number of fulfilled orders and establishing a more robust baseline solution. Once the fulfillment ratio improves, we can consider switching to other heuristic categories for further optimization.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1.0->2.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3923->3863
Fulfilled Order Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Heuristic Category: sequence_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where only two orders have been fulfilled, and the fulfillment ratio remains very low at 0.02, it is crucial to enhance the efficiency of the existing solution. The deadline-sensitive approach has laid a foundation by fulfilling urgent orders, but the progress is slow. Switching to the sequence_optimization category can help improve the order sequence on production lines, potentially reducing transition times and increasing the number of fulfilled orders. This approach will address inefficiencies in the current sequence, making it possible to fit more orders within given deadlines and utilize production lines more effectively.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2.0->2.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3863->3863
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->2
---Round 3---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, with a low fulfillment ratio of 0.02 and only two orders fulfilled, it appears the solution is still in an early phase. The previous attempt with sequence optimization did not yield an increase in fulfilled orders, indicating that the sequence alone may not be the primary issue at this stage. Returning to the deadline-sensitive category could help by focusing on fulfilling more urgent orders quickly, thus increasing the number of fulfilled orders and creating a more robust baseline. This approach will ensure that the most critical orders are prioritized, potentially boosting the fulfillment ratio more effectively at this point.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2.0->3.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3863->3834
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->3
---Round 4---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Heuristic Category: sequence_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state where the fulfillment ratio is still very low at 0.03 and only three orders have been fulfilled, it's clear that the solution needs further refinement. The deadline-sensitive approach has established a basic foundation by focusing on urgent orders, but progress remains slow. Switching to the sequence_optimization category could help improve the sequence of orders on the production lines, potentially reducing transition times and increasing the number of fulfilled orders. By optimizing the sequence, we can address inefficiencies and make room for additional orders within the existing time constraints, thus enhancing overall production efficiency.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 3.0->3.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3834->3834
Fulfilled Order Num: 3->3
---Round 5---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where the fulfillment ratio is still very low at 0.03 and only three orders have been fulfilled, it is crucial to focus on quickly increasing the number of fulfilled orders. The sequence optimization attempts have not yielded any increase in fulfilled orders, indicating that optimizing the sequence alone may not address the primary issues at this stage. Returning to the deadline-sensitive category can help prioritize and fulfill more urgent orders, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio more effectively. This approach will ensure that the most critical orders are handled first, which may lead to a better foundation for further improvements in subsequent iterations.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 3.0->4.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3834->3818
Fulfilled Order Num: 3->4
---Round 6---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Heuristic Category: load_balancing
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where the fulfillment ratio is still very low at 0.04 and only four orders have been fulfilled, it's crucial to explore strategies that can better utilize the production lines. The deadline-sensitive approach has helped prioritize urgent orders, but progress remains slow. Switching to the load_balancing category may help distribute orders more evenly across the production lines, potentially allowing more orders to be fulfilled within the available time constraints. This approach could improve overall production efficiency by balancing the workload and reducing idle time on less utilized lines, which may lead to a better foundation for further improvements in subsequent iterations.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 4.0->4.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 3818->3818
Fulfilled Order Num: 4->4

The last heuristic category is: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(load_balancing). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: deadline_sensitive,sequence_optimization,load_balancing,flexibility_and_feasibility

assistant
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:deadline_sensitive
explanation: Given the current state of the solution, the fulfillment ratio is still very low at 0.04, with only four orders fulfilled. Although load balancing was attempted in the last round, it did not result in any further order fulfillment, indicating that simply shifting orders between lines may not be sufficient at this stage. Returning to the deadline-sensitive category can help prioritize and fulfill more urgent orders, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio more effectively. This approach will ensure that the most critical orders are handled first, possibly leading to a better foundation for further improvements in subsequent iterations.***
