                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

It involves finding an optimal sequence of production actions across multiple production lines to maximize the number of completed orders before their deadlines. The problem's combinatorial nature arises from the necessity to explore different permutations of order scheduling across various production lines, considering constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. Heuristic methods are well-suited for this type of problem because they can efficiently search through large solution spaces and provide good approximate solutions within reasonable time frames.

This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.\n\nsequence_optimization: These heuristics focus on optimizing the sequence of orders to improve schedule efficiency, often by swapping or reversing segments.\ndef _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.\ndef exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\n\nload_balancing: This heuristic attempts to balance the load across production lines by shifting orders between them.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\n\nflexibility_and_feasibility: These heuristics consider future scheduling flexibility and feasibility when prioritizing orders, aiming to maintain an adaptable production schedule.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nproduct_num:20\nproduction_line_num:10\norder_num:100\norder_product:[10, 8, 6, 3, 0, 8, 19, 10, 16, 1, 5, 0, 3, 12, 16, 1, 11, 2, 17, 9, 1, 10, 13, 12, 7, 4, 13, 5, 8, 3, 13, 1, 9, 18, 19, 10, 13, 17, 17, 1, 1, 8, 19, 2, 8, 14, 12, 4, 16, 17, 18, 8, 14, 14, 12, 1, 19, 14, 7, 4, 7, 4, 0, 14, 8, 5, 10, 18, 10, 7, 13, 6, 0, 14, 1, 8, 4, 0, 7, 2, 18, 4, 3, 6, 13, 7, 3, 1, 12, 16, 5, 0, 5, 3, 19, 11, 12, 17, 15, 6]\norder_quantity:[60.0, 45.0, 15.0, 10.0, 3.0, 30.0, 6.0, 60.0, 20.0, 20.0, 4.0, 1.0, 10.0, 60.0, 20.0, 20.0, 10.0, 3.0, 4.0, 20.0, 10.0, 60.0, 30.0, 60.0, 9.0, 2.0, 60.0, 4.0, 30.0, 5.0, 60.0, 20.0, 20.0, 60.0, 9.0, 60.0, 60.0, 4.0, 4.0, 20.0, 20.0, 15.0, 6.0, 9.0, 15.0, 2.0, 90.0, 3.0, 30.0, 6.0, 90.0, 45.0, 2.0, 2.0, 90.0, 20.0, 3.0, 2.0, 9.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 2.0, 15.0, 2.0, 60.0, 60.0, 30.0, 6.0, 90.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 20.0, 30.0, 3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 9.0, 30.0, 2.0, 10.0, 10.0, 90.0, 6.0, 5.0, 10.0, 60.0, 10.0, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 15.0, 6.0, 30.0, 60.0, 6.0, 60.0, 10.0]\norder_deadline:[8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 16.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0, 24.0]\naverage_production_rate:[0.0, 1.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.8, 1.5, 2.1, 1.0, 1.7, 2.1, 0.0, 1.3, 1.0, 0.2, 2.3, 0.3]\nmaximum_transition_time:inf\naverage_order_quantity:22.48\ndeadline_variance:42.87999999999998\nproduct_to_order_ratio:0.2\naverage_deadline_per_product:[17.333333333333332, 14.222222222222221, 16.0, 16.0, 17.333333333333332, 16.0, 20.0, 17.333333333333332, 14.0, 8.0, 10.666666666666666, 16.0, 16.0, 12.0, 17.333333333333332, 24.0, 14.0, 12.8, 16.0, 14.4]\nproduction_line_utilization_potential:[inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status.

Here\u2019s a proposed framework that can help in systematically approaching the problem by alternating between various heuristic strategies during the construction and improvement phases:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution\n\n#### Phase 1: Initialization\n- **Objective:** Quickly generate an initial feasible solution.\n- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Construction Heuristics\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    1. **Deadline-Sensitive Heuristics:** Start with `greedy_by_order_density_de77` to quickly prioritize orders that are most urgent and feasible based on deadlines.\n    2. **Flexibility and Feasibility Heuristics:** Use `least_order_remaining_27ca` to refine the initial solution by considering future scheduling flexibility and feasibility.\n  - **Evaluation:** Check if the initial solution meets basic feasibility and deadline constraints. If not, iterate within these heuristics to adjust parameters.\n\n#### Phase 2: Construction\n- **Objective:** Build upon the initial solution to construct a more robust schedule.\n- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Deadline-Sensitive and Load Balancing\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    1. **Deadline-Sensitive:** Continue using `shortest_operation_ae31` for optimizing the sequence based on deadlines and feasibility.\n    2. **Load Balancing:** Introduce `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to distribute the workload evenly across production lines, improving overall efficiency.\n  - **Evaluation:** After each heuristic application, assess the number of fulfilled orders and balance across lines. Adjust strategies based on performance metrics.\n\n#### Phase 3: Improvement\n- **Objective:** Optimize the existing schedule by enhancing efficiency and reducing production times.\n- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Sequence Optimization and Flexibility and Feasibility\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    1. **Sequence Optimization:** Apply `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and `exchange_production_orders_eda2` to optimize the order sequence, focusing on reducing transition times and enhancing schedule efficiency.\n    2. **Flexibility and Feasibility:** Revisit `greedy_by_order_density_de77` and `least_order_remaining_27ca` to ensure the schedule remains adaptable to potential changes.\n  - **Evaluation:** Evaluate improvements in terms of reduced total time and increased order completion. Iterate between sequence optimization and flexibility strategies.\n\n#### Phase 4: Iteration and Adaptation\n- **Objective:** Continuously refine the schedule based on performance feedback.\n- **Primary Heuristic Category:** Adaptation and Iteration\n  - **Execution Steps:**\n    1. Continuously alternate between different heuristics from the above categories, adjusting parameters based on the solution\u2019s current state and performance metrics.\n    2. Periodically reassess which heuristics are providing the most benefit and adapt the strategy accordingly.\n  - **Evaluation:** Regularly assess performance metrics such as total fulfilled orders, production line utilization, and adherence to deadlines. Use this data to inform future heuristic selections.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Avoid Over-Reliance on a Single Heuristic:** Regularly switch between different heuristics to prevent local optima and explore diverse solution landscapes.\n- **Iterative Testing and Evaluation:** Implement a feedback loop where the results of each heuristic application inform the next steps.\n- **Parameter Tuning:** Continuously adjust heuristic parameters based on observed performance to optimize their effectiveness.\n\nThis strategic guide serves as a flexible framework to navigate through the DPOSP by leveraging a diverse set of heuristics, ensuring both the construction and improvement phases are effectively managed."
