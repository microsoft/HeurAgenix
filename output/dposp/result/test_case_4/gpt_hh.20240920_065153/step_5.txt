I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing scenarios where each heuristic is applicable can help you choose the best strategy based on the specific characteristics of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP). Here's an analysis of each heuristic and the scenarios in which they might be most effective:

### 1. Exchange Production Orders (EDA2)
**Scenario:** This heuristic is useful when the current schedule is suboptimal due to poor order sequencing. If there are large gaps or inefficiencies caused by non-optimal transitions between orders, swapping orders can help.
**Quantification:** High transition time variance and moderate to high order deadlines variability.

### 2. Farthest Deadline Insertion (7E8A)
**Scenario:** When the schedule is tight and the primary concern is meeting deadlines, this heuristic prioritizes orders with the farthest deadlines, ensuring they are not missed while minimally impacting the existing schedule.
**Quantification:** High variance in order deadlines and tight deadlines.

### 3. Greedy by Order Density (C702)
**Scenario:** This heuristic is suitable when you need to balance between order value and production/transition times. It selects orders based on their 'density,' ensuring efficient use of resources.
**Quantification:** Moderate to high variation in production times and transition times.

### 4. Greedy Deadline Proximity (AC6E)
**Scenario:** Best for scenarios where deadlines are the primary constraint. This heuristic ensures that orders closest to their deadlines are scheduled first.
**Quantification:** Tight deadlines and high penalty for missing deadlines.

### 5. Greedy Order Selection (2882)
**Scenario:** Useful in general scenarios where a specific criterion (e.g., closest deadline or shortest processing time) is the main priority. This heuristic iteratively builds the schedule by adding the most suitable order based on the chosen criterion.
**Quantification:** Applicable to a wide range of scenarios with varying order and production line characteristics.

### 6. Least Order Remaining (9C3C)
**Scenario:** When minimizing the total remaining work is critical, this heuristic focuses on processing orders with the shortest remaining work first.
**Quantification:** Low to moderate variance in order quantities and production times.

### 7. Longest Order Next (C9CB)
**Scenario:** Suitable when there are large orders that need to be prioritized. This heuristic ensures that the most time-consuming orders are scheduled first, potentially freeing up capacity for smaller orders later.
**Quantification:** High variance in order quantities and production times.

### 8. Maximum Remaining Work Order (EC9C)
**Scenario:** When there is a need to maximize throughput by focusing on orders with the most remaining work that can still be feasibly scheduled.
**Quantification:** High variance in order quantities and deadlines.

### 9. Nearest Order Scheduling (1A5E)
**Scenario:** Best for minimizing transition times and ensuring tight scheduling by selecting the next order based on proximity in transition time and urgency in deadlines.
**Quantification:** High transition time variance and moderate to tight deadlines.

### 10. Order Shift Between Lines (BD0C)
**Scenario:** Useful when there is an imbalance in the load across production lines. This heuristic attempts to redistribute the load to ensure more balanced utilization.
**Quantification:** High variance in production line utilization.

### 11. Random (C05A)
**Scenario:** This heuristic can be useful for generating initial solutions or when exploring the solution space randomly to avoid local optima.
**Quantification:** High solution space complexity and unknown optimal solution characteristics.

### 12. Shortest Operation Time First (E891)
**Scenario:** When the goal is to minimize the overall processing time, this heuristic focuses on orders with the shortest processing times.
**Quantification:** Low to moderate variance in production times.

### 13. Shortest Order Next (25BD)
**Scenario:** Similar to the Shortest Operation Time First heuristic, but specifically focuses on the shortest orders. This is useful when there are many small orders that need to be processed efficiently.
**Quantification:** High number of small orders and low to moderate variance in order quantities.

### 14. 2-opt Production Sequence (8E5E)
**Scenario:** Useful for refining an existing schedule by improving the sequence of production orders. This heuristic is effective when the sequence of orders can be optimized to reduce total production and transition times.
**Quantification:** High variance in transition times and moderate to high order deadlines variability.

Before this discuss, we have already 5 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic is well-suited for starting the solution as it prioritizes orders based on their proximity to deadlines, ensuring that we handle the tightest deadlines first. This is crucial given the mixed deadline constraints in our data.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 37.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -734
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic will help balance the current schedule by focusing on orders with the farthest deadlines. This approach aims to minimize the increase in total production and transition times while maximizing the number of fulfilled orders, addressing the high number of unfulfilled orders efficiently.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 54.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -983
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 2---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic will help optimize the order sequence within each production line by considering production rates, transition times, and order deadlines. This refinement should lead to a more efficient schedule, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders and reducing the total time cost for all production lines.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: greedy_order_selection_2882
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Greedy Order Selection will help identify and add the most suitable orders iteratively, taking into account both deadlines and production times. This should help in improving the fulfillment ratio and overall schedule efficiency.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 34.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -554
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 4---
Heuristic: greedy_order_selection_2882
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The Greedy Order Selection heuristic has been effective in previous rounds, adding 10 fulfilled orders each time. Continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps should help increase the number of fulfilled orders further, improving the overall fulfillment ratio and efficiency of the production schedule.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 46.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -837
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_order_selection_2882. How does greedy_order_selection_2882 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx

assistant
Based on the provided data and the progress made so far, here is my analysis and recommendation for the next steps:

### Analysis of Current State:
- **Fulfilled Orders:** 40
- **Unfulfilled Orders:** 60
- **Fulfillment Ratio:** 0.4
- **Feasible Orders to Fulfill:** 11
- **Total Time Cost per Production Line:** [20.0, 8.0, 9.0, 18.0, 20.0, 17.0, 23.0, 18.0, 17.0, 21.0]
- **Average Time Cost:** 17.1
- **Max Time Cost:** 23.0

### Heuristic Performance Summary:
- **Greedy Deadline Proximity (Round 0):** Added 10 fulfilled orders.
- **Farthest Deadline Insertion (Round 1):** Added 10 fulfilled orders.
- **2-opt Production Sequence (Round 2):** No improvement.
- **Greedy Order Selection (Rounds 3 and 4):** Added 10 fulfilled orders each round.

### Considerations:
- The **Greedy Order Selection** heuristic has consistently added 10 fulfilled orders in each round it was applied.
- The **2-opt Production Sequence** heuristic did not yield improvements, indicating that the current order sequences are relatively optimal.
- The feasible orders to fulfill have decreased significantly, indicating that further improvements might be harder to achieve.

### Decision:
Given the steady performance of the Greedy Order Selection heuristic and the diminishing feasible orders to fulfill, it seems prudent to continue with this heuristic for another round to see if we can push the fulfillment ratio higher.

### Recommendation:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_order_selection_2882
running steps: 10
explanation: The Greedy Order Selection heuristic has proven effective in previous rounds, consistently adding 10 fulfilled orders each time. Continuing with this heuristic for another 10 steps should help increase the number of fulfilled orders further, improving the overall fulfillment ratio and efficiency of the production schedule.
