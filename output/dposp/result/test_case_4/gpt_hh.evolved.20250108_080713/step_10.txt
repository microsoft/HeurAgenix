I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

Analysis: The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of operations on multiple production lines to fulfill orders under constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. The hyper-heuristics framework you've described, which includes various operators for modifying solutions, is well-suited for solving such problems. This approach allows for exploring different solution spaces effectively, making it appropriate for combinatorial optimization challenges.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic involves understanding the unique features of each method and identifying scenarios where these features are most beneficial. Here are possible scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when the production schedule is suboptimal due to poor order sequencing, resulting in inefficient production and transition times. 
   - **Quantification**: High number of orders with varying transition times or when there is flexibility in rearranging orders without violating deadlines.

2. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable when there is a need to prioritize orders with tight deadlines or when certain orders are critical to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.
   - **Quantification**: A large proportion of orders are close to their deadlines, or there is a need to maximize the number of completed orders in a short time frame.

3. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful when the workload is unevenly distributed across production lines, or when certain lines are better suited to handle specific orders due to their capabilities.
   - **Quantification**: Significant imbalance in production line workloads or when specific orders are not being fulfilled due to line capability mismatches.

4. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective when there is a need to quickly determine a feasible schedule by focusing on orders that can be completed quickly and have a high probability of success.
   - **Quantification**: Presence of orders with varying levels of flexibility and deadlines, requiring a balance between immediate feasibility and future scheduling potential.

5. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used when the order sequence within a production line can be optimized to improve efficiency, reduce transition times, or increase the number of fulfilled orders.
   - **Quantification**: High number of orders within a single production line with potential for sequence optimization, especially when transition times are variable.

6. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when there is a need to dynamically adjust the schedule to prioritize orders with short production times or to optimize the overall schedule through local adjustments.
   - **Quantification**: Presence of orders with diverse production times and deadlines, requiring continuous optimization to maintain an efficient schedule.

Each heuristic is designed to address specific challenges within the DPOSP, and their effectiveness can be quantified based on the characteristics of the order set and the production environment. Employing the right heuristic depends on the structure of the problem at hand, such as the number of orders, their deadlines, production line capabilities, and transition times.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current state and the alternating strategy between constructive and improvement heuristics, the last heuristic applied was an improvement heuristic (_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e). Therefore, we should now switch to a constructive heuristic to further build on the current solution.

Based on this, I recommend using the `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic for the next step to constructively enhance the solution by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times.

Here is my suggestion:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
running steps: 10
explanation: Applying the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help prioritize orders and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders. This approach aligns with the strategy of alternating between constructive and improvement heuristics to iteratively build a more optimal solution.
