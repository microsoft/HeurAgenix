I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

### Analysis of Heuristics and Their Applicable Scenarios:

#### 1. **`exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**
   - **Description:** This heuristic exchanges two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines to reduce total production and transition times.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When the production schedule has suboptimal sequences leading to high transition costs.
     - When the production lines are underutilized due to inefficient order placement.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large for certain sequences).
     - Low `fulfilled_order_num` relative to `order_num`.
     - Cases where swapping orders significantly reduces total time cost (`get_time_cost_delta()` returns high values for swaps).

#### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**
   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and future scheduling flexibility.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When there are many orders with varying deadlines and quantities.
     - When some orders have very tight deadlines, requiring prioritization to avoid invalid completions.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.
     - Presence of orders with tight deadlines (`D_k` values are close to current time plus production/transition time).
     - High number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).

#### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca()`**
   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and maximizing fulfilled orders.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When the objective is to maximize the total number of fulfilled orders.
     - When orders have varying deadlines but the focus is less on sequence optimization and more on individual order selection.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.
     - Many feasible orders available for scheduling (`len(feasible_orders_to_fulfill)` is high).
     - Relatively low `fulfilled_order_num`.

#### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**
   - **Description:** Shifts an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and deadlines.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When certain production lines are overburdened, causing unfulfilled orders, while others are underutilized.
     - When specific orders cannot be completed on their current production line due to transition or feasibility constraints.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - Imbalance in `total_time_cost_per_production_line` (some production lines have significantly higher costs than others).
     - High `len(unfulfilled_orders)`.
     - Production lines with minimal utilization (`total_time_cost_per_production_line` close to 0).

#### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31()`**
   - **Description:** Dynamically prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times while optimizing the schedule through swaps and shifts.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When the scheduling problem is complex, with many overlapping constraints (e.g., tight deadlines, high transition times, varying production speeds).
     - When the objective is to balance order fulfillment while minimizing time costs.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - High variance in `order_deadline`, `v_ip`, and `t_i,p,p'` values.
     - Large number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).
     - Scenarios where `validation_solution()` fails for many naive schedules, indicating a highly constrained problem.

#### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**
   - **Description:** Adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line.
   - **Applicable Scenarios:**
     - When the sequence of orders within a production line is suboptimal, leading to high transition costs or unmet deadlines.
     - When production lines have high utilization but inefficient sequencing.
   - **Best Quantified By:**
     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large within production lines).
     - High `total_time_cost_per_production_line`.
     - Cases where reversing segments significantly improves schedule feasibility (`validation_single_production_schedule()` returns `True` after applying reverse operations).

---

### Summary of Heuristic Applicability:
1. **Sequencing-focused Heuristics:**
   - `exchange_production_orders_eda2()` and `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()` are best suited for improving order sequences within and between production lines to reduce transition costs and improve scheduling efficiency.
   - These are quantified by high transition costs and suboptimal sequencing.

2. **Order-prioritization Heuristics:**
   - `greedy_by_order_density_de77()` and `least_order_remaining_27ca()` focus on selecting orders based on deadlines and feasibility to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.
   - These are quantified by high variance in deadlines and a large number of unfulfilled orders.

3. **Load-balancing Heuristics:**
   - `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()` is designed to balance the workload across production lines by shifting orders.
   - This is quantified by imbalances in production line utilization and the presence of unfulfilled orders.

4. **Comprehensive Optimization:**
   - `shortest_operation_ae31()` combines prioritization, sequencing, and dynamic optimization, making it suitable for complex scenarios with overlapping constraints.
   - This is quantified by high variance in constraints and many failed schedule validations.

Each heuristic addresses specific aspects of the DPOSP problem, and their applicability depends on the characteristics of the input data (e.g., deadlines, transition times, and production capabilities).

Before this discuss, we have already 3 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the initial state data, the fulfillment ratio is currently 0.0, and all orders are unfulfilled. The feasible orders to fulfill are 81 out of 100, indicating a high potential for scheduling. The heuristic `greedy_by_order_density_de77` is suitable because it prioritizes orders based on deadline tightness, feasibility, and flexibility, aligning with the goal of incrementally building an initial feasible solution. Running 10 steps allows us to construct a baseline schedule while minimizing computational cost at this stage.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 13.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -414
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: The current fulfillment ratio is low (0.1), and the unfulfilled orders are high in number and quantity. With 71 feasible orders to fulfill and a high variance in deadlines, it is important to dynamically prioritize orders while optimizing the sequence to reduce time costs. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it incorporates dynamic prioritization, order shifts, and swaps to maximize fulfilled orders efficiently. Running 15 steps ensures adequate exploration while progressing towards better utilization of production lines.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 30.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1165
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 15
---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The fulfillment ratio is still low (0.25), with 75 unfulfilled orders and a significant unfulfilled order quantity sum of 2065. The feasible orders to fulfill count is 40, indicating a reasonable opportunity for further optimization. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic continues to be suitable at this stage due to its ability to dynamically prioritize orders, optimize sequences, and explore shifts/swaps. Increasing the running steps to 20 will allow deeper exploration and refinement of the current solution, potentially leading to higher fulfillment and better production line utilization.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 64.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1325
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 19

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

assistant
***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31  
running steps: 25  
hype parameter(optional): None  
explanation: The fulfillment ratio is still relatively low at 0.44, and there are 56 unfulfilled orders with a significant unfulfilled order quantity sum of 1786. While the feasible orders to fulfill count has decreased to 15, indicating a more constrained solution space, the `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic remains well-suited for this stage. It dynamically prioritizes orders, optimizes sequences, and explores shifts/swaps, which aligns with the need to maximize fulfilled orders and improve production line utilization. Increasing the running steps to 25 allows for deeper exploration to address the remaining unfulfilled orders and further refine the current solution.
