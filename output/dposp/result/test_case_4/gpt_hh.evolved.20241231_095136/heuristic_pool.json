                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

**Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the production schedule has suboptimal sequences leading to high transition costs.\n     - When the production lines are underutilized due to inefficient order placement.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large for certain sequences).\n     - Low `fulfilled_order_num` relative to `order_num`.\n     - Cases where swapping orders significantly reduces total time cost (`get_time_cost_delta()` returns high values for swaps).\n\n#### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**\n   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and future scheduling flexibility.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When there are many orders with varying deadlines and quantities.\n     - When some orders have very tight deadlines, requiring prioritization to avoid invalid completions.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.\n     - Presence of orders with tight deadlines (`D_k` values are close to current time plus production/transition time).\n     - High number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).\n\n#### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca()`**\n   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and maximizing fulfilled orders.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the objective is to maximize the total number of fulfilled orders.\n     - When orders have varying deadlines but the focus is less on sequence optimization and more on individual order selection.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.\n     - Many feasible orders available for scheduling (`len(feasible_orders_to_fulfill)` is high).\n     - Relatively low `fulfilled_order_num`.\n\n#### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**\n   - **Description:** Shifts an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and deadlines.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When certain production lines are overburdened, causing unfulfilled orders, while others are underutilized.\n     - When specific orders cannot be completed on their current production line due to transition or feasibility constraints.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - Imbalance in `total_time_cost_per_production_line` (some production lines have significantly higher costs than others).\n     - High `len(unfulfilled_orders)`.\n     - Production lines with minimal utilization (`total_time_cost_per_production_line` close to 0).\n\n#### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31()`**\n   - **Description:** Dynamically prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times while optimizing the schedule through swaps and shifts.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the scheduling problem is complex, with many overlapping constraints (e.g., tight deadlines, high transition times, varying production speeds).\n     - When the objective is to balance order fulfillment while minimizing time costs.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline`, `v_ip`, and `t_i,p,p'` values.\n     - Large number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).\n     - Scenarios where `validation_solution()` fails for many naive schedules, indicating a highly constrained problem.\n\n#### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**\n   - **Description:** Adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the sequence of orders within a production line is suboptimal, leading to high transition costs or unmet deadlines.\n     - When production lines have high utilization but inefficient sequencing.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large within production lines).\n     - High `total_time_cost_per_production_line`.\n     - Cases where reversing segments significantly improves schedule feasibility (`validation_single_production_schedule()` returns `True` after applying reverse operations).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Heuristic Applicability:\n1. **Sequencing-focused Heuristics:**\n   - `exchange_production_orders_eda2()` and `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()` are best suited for improving order sequences within and between production lines to reduce transition costs and improve scheduling efficiency.\n   - These are quantified by high transition costs and suboptimal sequencing.\n\n2. **Order-prioritization Heuristics:**\n   - `greedy_by_order_density_de77()` and `least_order_remaining_27ca()` focus on selecting orders based on deadlines and feasibility to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.\n   - These are quantified by high variance in deadlines and a large number of unfulfilled orders.\n\n3. **Load-balancing Heuristics:**\n   - `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()` is designed to balance the workload across production lines by shifting orders.\n   - This is quantified by imbalances in production line utilization and the presence of unfulfilled orders.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Optimization:**\n   - `shortest_operation_ae31()` combines prioritization, sequencing, and dynamic optimization, making it suitable for complex scenarios with overlapping constraints.\n   - This is quantified by high variance in constraints and many failed schedule validations.\n\nEach heuristic addresses specific aspects of the DPOSP problem, and their applicability depends on the characteristics of the input data (e.g., deadlines, transition times, and production capabilities)."
