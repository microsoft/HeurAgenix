                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

**Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the production schedule has suboptimal sequences leading to high transition costs.\n     - When the production lines are underutilized due to inefficient order placement.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large for certain sequences).\n     - Low `fulfilled_order_num` relative to `order_num`.\n     - Cases where swapping orders significantly reduces total time cost (`get_time_cost_delta()` returns high values for swaps).\n\n#### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**\n   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and future scheduling flexibility.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When there are many orders with varying deadlines and quantities.\n     - When some orders have very tight deadlines, requiring prioritization to avoid invalid completions.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.\n     - Presence of orders with tight deadlines (`D_k` values are close to current time plus production/transition time).\n     - High number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).\n\n#### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca()`**\n   - **Description:** Prioritizes orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and maximizing fulfilled orders.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the objective is to maximize the total number of fulfilled orders.\n     - When orders have varying deadlines but the focus is less on sequence optimization and more on individual order selection.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline` values.\n     - Many feasible orders available for scheduling (`len(feasible_orders_to_fulfill)` is high).\n     - Relatively low `fulfilled_order_num`.\n\n#### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**\n   - **Description:** Shifts an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and deadlines.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When certain production lines are overburdened, causing unfulfilled orders, while others are underutilized.\n     - When specific orders cannot be completed on their current production line due to transition or feasibility constraints.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - Imbalance in `total_time_cost_per_production_line` (some production lines have significantly higher costs than others).\n     - High `len(unfulfilled_orders)`.\n     - Production lines with minimal utilization (`total_time_cost_per_production_line` close to 0).\n\n#### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31()`**\n   - **Description:** Dynamically prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times while optimizing the schedule through swaps and shifts.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the scheduling problem is complex, with many overlapping constraints (e.g., tight deadlines, high transition times, varying production speeds).\n     - When the objective is to balance order fulfillment while minimizing time costs.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High variance in `order_deadline`, `v_ip`, and `t_i,p,p'` values.\n     - Large number of unfulfilled orders (`len(unfulfilled_orders)` is large).\n     - Scenarios where `validation_solution()` fails for many naive schedules, indicating a highly constrained problem.\n\n#### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**\n   - **Description:** Adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line.\n   - **Applicable Scenarios:**\n     - When the sequence of orders within a production line is suboptimal, leading to high transition costs or unmet deadlines.\n     - When production lines have high utilization but inefficient sequencing.\n   - **Best Quantified By:**\n     - High transition times between consecutive products (`t_i,p,p'` values are large within production lines).\n     - High `total_time_cost_per_production_line`.\n     - Cases where reversing segments significantly improves schedule feasibility (`validation_single_production_schedule()` returns `True` after applying reverse operations).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Heuristic Applicability:\n1. **Sequencing-focused Heuristics:**\n   - `exchange_production_orders_eda2()` and `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()` are best suited for improving order sequences within and between production lines to reduce transition costs and improve scheduling efficiency.\n   - These are quantified by high transition costs and suboptimal sequencing.\n\n2. **Order-prioritization Heuristics:**\n   - `greedy_by_order_density_de77()` and `least_order_remaining_27ca()` focus on selecting orders based on deadlines and feasibility to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.\n   - These are quantified by high variance in deadlines and a large number of unfulfilled orders.\n\n3. **Load-balancing Heuristics:**\n   - `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()` is designed to balance the workload across production lines by shifting orders.\n   - This is quantified by imbalances in production line utilization and the presence of unfulfilled orders.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Optimization:**\n   - `shortest_operation_ae31()` combines prioritization, sequencing, and dynamic optimization, making it suitable for complex scenarios with overlapping constraints.\n   - This is quantified by high variance in constraints and many failed schedule validations.\n\nEach heuristic addresses specific aspects of the DPOSP problem, and their applicability depends on the characteristics of the input data (e.g., deadlines, transition times, and production capabilities)."

The feasible orders to fulfill are 81 out of 100, indicating a high potential for scheduling. The heuristic `greedy_by_order_density_de77` is suitable because it prioritizes orders based on deadline tightness, feasibility, and flexibility, aligning with the goal of incrementally building an initial feasible solution. Running 10 steps allows us to construct a baseline schedule while minimizing computational cost at this stage.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 13.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -414\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current fulfillment ratio is low (0.1), and the unfulfilled orders are high in number and quantity. With 71 feasible orders to fulfill and a high variance in deadlines, it is important to dynamically prioritize orders while optimizing the sequence to reduce time costs. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic is well-suited for this stage as it incorporates dynamic prioritization, order shifts, and swaps to maximize fulfilled orders efficiently. Running 15 steps ensures adequate exploration while progressing towards better utilization of production lines.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 30.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1165\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 15\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio is still low (0.25), with 75 unfulfilled orders and a significant unfulfilled order quantity sum of 2065. The feasible orders to fulfill count is 40, indicating a reasonable opportunity for further optimization. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic continues to be suitable at this stage due to its ability to dynamically prioritize orders, optimize sequences, and explore shifts/swaps. Increasing the running steps to 20 will allow deeper exploration and refinement of the current solution, potentially leading to higher fulfillment and better production line utilization.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 64.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1325\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 19\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 25\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio is still relatively low at 0.44, and there are 56 unfulfilled orders with a significant unfulfilled order quantity sum of 1786. While the feasible orders to fulfill count has decreased to 15, indicating a more constrained solution space, the `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic remains well-suited for this stage. It dynamically prioritizes orders, optimizes sequences, and explores shifts/swaps, which aligns with the need to maximize fulfilled orders and improve production line utilization. Increasing the running steps to 25 allows for deeper exploration to address the remaining unfulfilled orders and further refine the current solution.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 62.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1036\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 8\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 30\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio has reached 0.52, indicating progress but still leaving room for improvement. There are 48 unfulfilled orders with a total unfulfilled order quantity sum of 1417, and the feasible orders to fulfill count is currently 0, suggesting a more constrained solution space. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic has shown consistent performance in dynamically prioritizing orders and optimizing sequences in previous rounds, making it suitable for further refinement. Increasing the running steps to 30 allows for deeper exploration of potential improvements while maintaining alignment with the algorithm's strengths.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 40\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio has plateaued at 0.52, indicating diminishing returns from the previous runs. However, there are still 48 unfulfilled orders with a significant unfulfilled order quantity sum of 1417. The feasible orders to fulfill count is currently 0, implying that the solution space is constrained but not exhausted. Given that `shortest_operation_ae31` has consistently shown improvements in earlier rounds, it remains the most suitable heuristic to explore deeper optimizations. Increasing the running steps to 40 allows for a more thorough search for potential refinements while leveraging the dynamic prioritization and optimization strengths of this heuristic.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 40\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio has plateaued at 0.52, and the feasible orders to fulfill count is currently 0, indicating a constrained solution space. However, there are still 48 unfulfilled orders with a total unfulfilled order quantity sum of 1417, suggesting potential for further optimization. Given that `shortest_operation_ae31` has consistently demonstrated effectiveness in previous rounds by dynamically prioritizing orders and optimizing sequences, it remains the most suitable heuristic to explore deeper refinements. Running 40 steps allows for further exploration to potentially uncover additional improvements while leveraging the strengths of this heuristic.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.

Since previous runs of `shortest_operation_ae31` have not yielded further improvements, it is time to explore sequence optimization within individual production lines. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` is a sequencing-focused heuristic that can identify suboptimal transitions and improve the order sequence within production lines to reduce time costs and potentially enable further order fulfillment. Running 30 steps provides adequate exploration while transitioning the focus from dynamic prioritization to sequence refinement.  \n***"
