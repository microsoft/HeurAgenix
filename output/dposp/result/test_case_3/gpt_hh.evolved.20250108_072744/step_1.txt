I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you've described is a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves selecting and sequencing orders across multiple production lines to maximize the number of completed orders by their deadlines, which is a typical characteristic of combinatorial operations. The use of various operators to modify solutions aligns well with heuristic approaches, which are often employed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems due to their ability to efficiently explore large solution spaces and find good solutions within reasonable time frames.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing scenarios where each heuristic is applicable involves understanding the characteristics and constraints of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) and matching them with the strengths of each heuristic. Below is an analysis of when each heuristic might be most effective:

1. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when there are unfulfilled orders due to an imbalance in load distribution among production lines. It is most useful when certain lines are overburdened and others have spare capacity.
   - **Quantification**: Best quantified by the number of unfulfilled orders and the capacity utilization of each production line. If some lines have significantly lower utilization, this heuristic might be beneficial.

2. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic works well in situations where the current schedule is close to optimal, but minor adjustments could lead to improvements. It is suitable when the production schedule can be improved by swapping orders without violating constraints.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable when the total production and transition times are high, and there's potential to reduce these times by rearranging the order sequence.

3. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**: 
   - **Scenario**: Useful when the goal is to quickly generate an initial feasible solution by prioritizing orders with tight deadlines or high importance.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when there are many orders with varying deadlines and quantities, and a rapid solution is needed. The density score can be calculated based on the ratio of order quantity to available production capacity within the deadline.

4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**: 
   - **Scenario**: Effective in dynamic environments where continuous optimization is required. This heuristic adapts well to changes and seeks to improve the schedule iteratively.
   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with frequent order changes or when the order deadlines and production times are highly variable.

5. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**: 
   - **Scenario**: Best suited for fine-tuning the order sequence on each production line, particularly when the production and transition times are significant.
   - **Quantification**: Effective when the initial schedule has long production or transition times that could be reduced by optimizing the sequence. The heuristic is quantifiable by the reduction in total production and transition time achieved.

6. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**: 
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when prioritizing orders with tight deadlines and potential to maximize the number of completed orders.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when there are many orders nearing their deadlines, and the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders. The heuristic evaluates the remaining time until deadlines and adjusts the schedule accordingly.

Overall, the choice of heuristic depends on the specific characteristics of the problem instance, including the distribution of order deadlines, production capacities, and transition constraints. By evaluating these factors, one can select the most suitable heuristic or combination of heuristics to effectively address the DPOSP.

Running Steps: 10
Explain: Starting with a constructive approach using `shortest_operation_ae31` to build a feasible initial solution. This heuristic will help prioritize orders based on deadlines and feasibility, setting a foundation for further optimization with improvement heuristics.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 10.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -274
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current state data and the performance of the last heuristic, it seems appropriate to shift focus from the constructive approach to an improvement heuristic. The use of `shortest_operation_ae31` has provided a foundation, but the fulfillment ratio remains low, and the feasible orders to fulfill count has decreased significantly. This indicates a need to refine the current solution to better utilize production line capacities and fulfill more orders.

Considering the current solution state and the fulfillment ratio, applying an improvement heuristic like `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` could help optimize the order sequence on each production line, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders without drastically altering the existing structure. This heuristic focuses on reducing production and transition times, which aligns with the current objective of enhancing the solution.

Here's the suggested next step:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
running steps: 15
explanation: Applying the `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic to optimize the sequence of production orders on each line. This should help reduce production and transition times, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders and improving the overall solution efficiency.
