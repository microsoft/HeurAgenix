                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

The scenarios can be quantified based on factors such as the number of production lines, the number of orders, the diversity of products, the tightness of deadlines, and the complexity of transition times. Here's an analysis of each heuristic and its best-suited scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### **1. exchange_production_orders_eda2()**\n- **Introduction**: Swaps two non-adjacent orders within the same or different production lines to improve the overall schedule.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - **High transition times**: When transition times between products are large and significantly impact schedule efficiency.\n  - **Complex order dependencies**: When order fulfillment requires careful sequencing due to tight deadlines or machine capabilities.\n  - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n    - High variance in transition times (e.g., standard deviation of transition times > 20% of the mean).\n    - Moderate to high number of orders (e.g., >50 orders), where finding an optimal sequence through swaps can yield significant improvements.\n    - Tight deadlines, where a swap can open up opportunities to fulfill critical orders.\n\n---\n\n### **2. greedy_by_order_density_de77()**\n- **Introduction**: Prioritizes orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and scheduling flexibility.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - **Order prioritization is critical**: When some orders have tight deadlines or are more constrained by production feasibility.\n  - **High diversity in product requirements**: When products require different production rates or transitions, making order prioritization impactful.\n  - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n    - Large differences in order deadlines (e.g., range of deadlines > 50% of the average deadline).\n    - Uneven production speeds across lines, requiring careful order assignment.\n    - High disparity in order quantities, where smaller orders can be prioritized to maximize fulfilled orders.\n\n---\n\n### **3. least_order_remaining_27ca()**\n- **Introduction**: Focuses on orders with the highest potential to maximize the number of fulfilled orders, considering deadline proximity and feasibility.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - **Tight scheduling windows**: When many orders have deadlines that are close and require careful prioritization.\n  - **Maximizing throughput**: When the goal is to fulfill as many orders as possible, regardless of their specific quantities or deadlines.\n  - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n    - High density of orders with deadlines within a narrow range (e.g., >50% of orders have deadlines within 10% of the average deadline).\n    - Moderate to high number of orders with varying quantities (e.g., >50 orders, with quantities differing by >30%).\n\n---\n\n### **4. order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**\n- **Introduction**: Attempts to shift orders between production lines to improve feasibility and adherence to deadlines.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - **Uneven production line utilization**: When some production lines are overburdened while others are underutilized.\n  - **High machine specialization**: When certain machines are better suited for specific products, requiring a strategic allocation of orders.\n  - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n    - Large disparity in production line utilization (e.g., >30% difference in total time cost between the most and least utilized lines).\n    - High variance in machine production speeds for different products (e.g., standard deviation of production speeds > 20% of the mean).\n\n---\n\n### **5. shortest_operation_ae31()**\n- **Introduction**: Dynamically prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times, while exploring insertion and shift opportunities.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  - **Dynamic and adaptive scheduling**: When the problem is highly dynamic, and a flexible approach is needed to adjust schedules iteratively.\n  - **Tight deadlines with high complexity**: When many orders must be scheduled in a short time frame, and feasibility is a key constraint.\n  - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n    - High number of unfulfilled orders due to deadline constraints (e.g., >30% of orders initially unfulfilled).\n    - High variability in order deadlines and production times (e.g., standard deviation of deadlines > 20% of the mean).\n\n---\n\n### **6. _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**\n- **Introduction**: Adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to improve order sequences on production lines by swapping non-adjacent orders.\n- **Best Applicable Scenarios**:\n  -

The `greedy_by_order_density_de77` heuristic is well-suited for this early stage to strategically build a foundation for future optimization.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 10.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -403\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio is currently very low (0.1), and there is a significant number of unfulfilled orders (98). The previous heuristic, `greedy_by_order_density_de77`, helped prioritize feasible orders but still left room for sequence optimization. Given the current partial solution's production line schedules, `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` can refine the order sequence within individual production lines, minimizing transition times and improving efficiency. Since the feasible order count is still high (88), this heuristic can further optimize the sequence before considering more complex strategies like shifting orders between lines. Running for 10 steps allows a small trial to evaluate its effectiveness before potentially switching to a more advanced heuristic like 3-opt.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous 10 steps of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` showed no changes in the total time cost, feasible orders to fulfill, or fulfilled orders. However, this does not necessarily indicate the heuristic is ineffective, as 2-opt often requires multiple iterations to converge on a meaningful improvement. Given the low fulfillment ratio (0.1), a significant number of unfulfilled orders (88), and the potential for further sequence optimization within production lines, another 10 steps of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` are warranted. This will allow further exploration of sequence improvements while assessing its continued viability before switching to a more advanced heuristic like 3-opt.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous two rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` did not show measurable improvements in terms of total time cost, feasible orders, or fulfilled orders. However, considering that 2-opt often requires iterative exploration to uncover sequence improvements, a final small trial of 10 steps is justified before deciding on its effectiveness. If no improvement is observed in this round, it would be prudent to explore more advanced heuristics such as 3-opt or order-shifting strategies. This round serves as a conclusive test for this heuristic.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` have not yielded measurable improvements after 30 steps, indicating that sequence optimization within individual production lines has reached its limit. Considering the significant number of unfulfilled orders (88) and the low fulfillment ratio (0.1), it is now critical to explore shifting orders between production lines to balance utilization and potentially free up capacity for more feasible orders. The `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` heuristic is appropriate at this stage to address uneven production line utilization and unlock opportunities for fulfilling additional orders. Running it for 10 steps will allow a preliminary assessment of its effectiveness.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and the initial trial of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` did not yield measurable improvements, but shifting orders between production lines remains a viable strategy to address the low fulfillment ratio (0.1) and high number of unfulfilled orders (88). Given that uneven utilization and potential machine specialization could still impact performance, running an additional 10 steps of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` will allow further exploration of its effectiveness before considering a switch to alternative heuristics like 3-opt or greedy methods.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous trials of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` did not yield measurable improvements; however, shifting orders between production lines remains a viable strategy. With the current low fulfillment ratio (0.1) and significant number of unfulfilled orders (88), further exploration of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` is warranted to address uneven production line utilization and machine specialization. Running an additional 10 steps will help evaluate whether this heuristic can unlock opportunities for fulfilling more orders. If no measurable improvement is observed, it may be time to consider switching to a more advanced heuristic like 3-opt.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous trials of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` did not yield measurable improvements, but given the current low fulfillment ratio (0.1) and high number of unfulfilled orders (88), it is worth exploring further. Uneven production line utilization and potential machine specialization still make this heuristic a viable choice. Running an additional 10 steps will help determine if shifting orders between production lines can unlock opportunities for fulfilling more orders. If no significant improvement is observed after this round, we may consider switching to 3-opt or another heuristic strategy.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current fulfillment ratio remains very low (0.1), and the high number of unfulfilled orders (88) indicates that the solution requires further improvement. While the previous trials of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` did not yield measurable improvements, uneven production line utilization and potential machine specialization still make this heuristic a viable option. Running an additional 10 steps will allow further exploration of whether shifting orders between production lines can unlock opportunities for fulfilling more orders. If no significant improvement is observed after this round, we should consider switching to a more advanced heuristic like `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `shortest_operation_ae31`.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given that the previous rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` have not yielded measurable improvements, it is time to explore a different strategy. The `exchange_production_orders_eda2` heuristic is well-suited for this stage, as it can refine the schedule by swapping non-adjacent orders within or across production lines to potentially unlock opportunities for fulfilling additional orders. This is particularly relevant given the high number of unfulfilled orders (88) and the low fulfillment ratio (0.1). Running 10 steps will allow for an assessment of its impact before deciding on the next course of action.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The previous rounds of `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` and `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` did not yield measurable improvements, and the fulfillment ratio remains very low (0.1), with 88 unfulfilled orders. `exchange_production_orders_eda2` is suited to refine the schedule by swapping non-adjacent orders within or across production lines, potentially unlocking opportunities to fulfill more orders.

How does exchange_production_orders_eda2 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important.
