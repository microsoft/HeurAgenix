I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves scheduling a series of decisions (production actions) across multiple machines, which is a hallmark of combinatorial optimization problems. The solution involves finding an optimal sequence of these decisions to maximize the number of completed orders, given constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and order deadlines. 

The use of heuristic approaches is appropriate here, as combinatorial operation problems often have large, complex solution spaces where traditional optimization methods may be computationally expensive or infeasible. The framework you've described, with the Solution and Operator classes, is well-suited for implementing and testing various heuristic algorithms to find good solutions efficiently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): deadline_sensitive,efficiency_improvement,flexibility_optimization,feasibility_based

deadline_sensitive: these heuristics prioritize orders based on deadlines and aim to fulfill as many orders as possible before their deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

efficiency_improvement: these heuristics aim to improve the efficiency of the current production schedule by swapping or reversing order sequences to reduce time costs.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

flexibility_optimization: these heuristics consider the flexibility of production lines and the potential impact of order shifts on future scheduling.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

feasibility_based: these heuristics focus on the feasibility of fulfilling orders based on current production capabilities and constraints.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To strategically guide the selection of heuristic categories and define execution steps for each phase, we'll consider the characteristics and objectives of each heuristic type, as well as the nature of the DPOSP problem and the available data. The goal is to iteratively refine the solution through alternating phases of construction and improvement, leveraging different heuristics as needed. Here's a proposed framework:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
1. **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible initial solution that respects constraints and sets a baseline for further improvement.
2. **Heuristic Category**: 
   - **Deadline-Sensitive**: Use heuristics that prioritize meeting order deadlines. This helps in constructing a schedule that maximizes the number of orders completed on time.
   - **Feasibility-Based**: Ensure the initial solution is feasible with respect to production capabilities and constraints.
3. **Execution Steps**:
   - Start with `greedy_by_order_density_de77` to prioritize orders by deadlines, feasibility, and potential flexibility.
   - Use `least_order_remaining_27ca` to further refine the order selection based on deadline proximity and production feasibility.
   - Validate the initial solution using feasibility checks (e.g., `validation_solution`).

#### Phase 2: Initial Solution Evaluation
1. **Objective**: Assess the performance of the initial solution to identify potential areas for improvement.
2. **Execution Steps**:
   - Calculate key performance metrics (e.g., total fulfilled orders, total time cost).
   - Identify bottlenecks or constraints that limit performance (e.g., production line overutilization, unmet deadlines).

#### Phase 3: Solution Improvement
1. **Objective**: Optimize the initial solution to improve efficiency and order fulfillment.
2. **Heuristic Category**:
   - **Efficiency Improvement**: Focus on reducing production and transition times through sequence optimization.
   - **Flexibility Optimization**: Explore the potential for order shifts that may open up better scheduling opportunities.
3. **Execution Steps**:
   - Apply `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to improve efficiency by adjusting order sequences.
   - Use `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to evaluate and implement beneficial order shifts between production lines.
   - Periodically validate the solution to ensure feasibility and check for further improvement opportunities.

#### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement and Switching
1. **Objective**: Continuously refine the solution by iteratively applying and switching between different heuristics.
2. **Execution Steps**:
   - Monitor the impact of applied heuristics on solution quality.
   - Switch heuristics if current ones yield diminishing returns or if specific constraints need addressing (e.g., switch from efficiency improvement to deadline-sensitive if deadline compliance drops).
   - Document results and learning from each iteration to inform future heuristic selection.

### Considerations for Heuristic Selection
- **Data Characteristics**: Understand key data features (e.g., average production rates, deadline variance) to tailor heuristic choice.
- **Solution Feedback**: Use feedback from solution evaluations to guide heuristic adjustments.
- **Diverse Approaches**: Avoid over-reliance on a single heuristic category. Balance between construction and improvement-focused heuristics to explore different optimization paths.

This strategic guide serves as a flexible framework for navigating the complex landscape of the DPOSP problem, allowing for adaptive and informed heuristic selection throughout the solution process.

Before this discuss, we have already 6 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Given that no orders have been fulfilled yet and all orders remain unfulfilled, it is crucial to start by building a feasible initial solution that prioritizes meeting order deadlines. The data indicates that most orders are feasible to fulfill, and focusing on deadline-sensitive heuristics will help quickly construct a solution that maximizes the number of orders completed on time. This approach will establish a strong foundation for further optimization in subsequent phases.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->1.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 4761->4759
Fulfilled Order Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Heuristic Category: efficiency_improvement
Running Steps: 1
Explain: The initial use of the deadline_sensitive heuristic has laid a foundation by fulfilling one order and maintaining a feasible solution with all constraints respected. Given that the fulfillment ratio is low (0.01) and there is a substantial number of feasible orders to fulfill, it is essential to focus on improving the efficiency of the current production schedule. By reducing production and transition times through an efficiency_improvement heuristic, we can potentially fulfill more orders within their deadlines, increasing the total number of completed orders.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1.0->1.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 4759->4759
Fulfilled Order Num: 1->1
---Round 2---
Heuristic: least_order_remaining_27ca
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state with only one fulfilled order and a very low fulfillment ratio (0.01), it's crucial to focus on fulfilling more orders on time. The efficiency improvement attempt didn't increase the number of fulfilled orders, indicating that the current schedule might not be aligned well with deadlines. Switching back to a deadline-sensitive heuristic can help prioritize and schedule orders that are closer to their deadlines, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio. This approach will aim to capitalize on the large number of feasible orders (97) that can still be scheduled without violating deadlines.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1.0->2.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 4759->4747
Fulfilled Order Num: 1->2
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Heuristic Category: efficiency_improvement
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current fulfillment ratio is very low at 0.02, with only 2 orders fulfilled out of 100. This indicates a need to optimize the existing production schedule further to fulfill more orders. While the deadline-sensitive approach has helped establish a baseline, the current focus should shift towards improving the efficiency of the schedule. By targeting efficiency improvement, we can look to reduce production and transition times, potentially opening up opportunities to fulfill more orders without violating deadlines. This shift in focus can leverage the existing feasible orders and help increase the total number of completed orders.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2.0->2.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 4747->4747
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->2
---Round 4---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current fulfillment ratio is very low at 0.02, with only 2 orders fulfilled out of 100, and a substantial number of feasible orders (96) remain. While efficiency improvement efforts have maintained solution validity, they have not increased the fulfillment ratio. A shift back to the deadline-sensitive category could help prioritize and schedule orders that are closer to their deadlines, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio. This approach aims to capitalize on the large number of feasible orders that can still be scheduled without violating deadlines, thereby improving the overall solution quality and increasing the number of fulfilled orders.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2.0->4.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 4747->4740
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->3
---Round 5---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Heuristic Category: efficiency_improvement
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current fulfillment ratio is still quite low at 0.03, with only 3 out of 100 orders fulfilled. The previous use of a deadline-sensitive heuristic has slightly improved the fulfillment ratio but hasn't significantly increased the number of fulfilled orders. Given the substantial number of feasible orders (95) and the existing production schedule's validity, it would be beneficial to focus on optimizing the efficiency of the current schedule. By targeting efficiency improvement, we can aim to reduce production and transition times, potentially opening up opportunities to fulfill more orders without violating deadlines. This approach can help increase the total number of completed orders, leveraging the existing feasible order list.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 4.0->4.0

The last heuristic category is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(efficiency_improvement). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: deadline_sensitive,efficiency_improvement,flexibility_optimization,feasibility_based

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:deadline_sensitive
explanation: The current fulfillment ratio remains very low at 0.03, with only 3 out of 100 orders fulfilled. While efficiency improvement efforts have maintained solution validity, they haven't significantly increased the fulfillment ratio. Given the substantial number of feasible orders (95) and the fact that many unfulfilled orders have tight deadlines, switching back to a deadline-sensitive heuristic could help prioritize and schedule these orders more effectively. This approach aims to improve the fulfillment ratio by focusing on meeting deadlines for orders that can still be completed within their time constraints, potentially increasing the total number of fulfilled orders.
