                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

The goal is to iteratively refine the solution through alternating phases of construction and improvement, leveraging different heuristics as needed. Here's a proposed framework:\n\n### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection\n\n#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction\n1. **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible initial solution that respects constraints and sets a baseline for further improvement.\n2. **Heuristic Category**: \n   - **Deadline-Sensitive**: Use heuristics that prioritize meeting order deadlines. This helps in constructing a schedule that maximizes the number of orders completed on time.\n   - **Feasibility-Based**: Ensure the initial solution is feasible with respect to production capabilities and constraints.\n3. **Execution Steps**:\n   - Start with `greedy_by_order_density_de77` to prioritize orders by deadlines, feasibility, and potential flexibility.\n   - Use `least_order_remaining_27ca` to further refine the order selection based on deadline proximity and production feasibility.\n   - Validate the initial solution using feasibility checks (e.g., `validation_solution`).\n\n#### Phase 2: Initial Solution Evaluation\n1. **Objective**: Assess the performance of the initial solution to identify potential areas for improvement.\n2. **Execution Steps**:\n   - Calculate key performance metrics (e.g., total fulfilled orders, total time cost).\n   - Identify bottlenecks or constraints that limit performance (e.g., production line overutilization, unmet deadlines).\n\n#### Phase 3: Solution Improvement\n1. **Objective**: Optimize the initial solution to improve efficiency and order fulfillment.\n2. **Heuristic Category**:\n   - **Efficiency Improvement**: Focus on reducing production and transition times through sequence optimization.\n   - **Flexibility Optimization**: Explore the potential for order shifts that may open up better scheduling opportunities.\n3. **Execution Steps**:\n   - Apply `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to improve efficiency by adjusting order sequences.\n   - Use `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to evaluate and implement beneficial order shifts between production lines.\n   - Periodically validate the solution to ensure feasibility and check for further improvement opportunities.\n\n#### Phase 4: Iterative Refinement and Switching\n1. **Objective**: Continuously refine the solution by iteratively applying and switching between different heuristics.\n2. **Execution Steps**:\n   - Monitor the impact of applied heuristics on solution quality.\n   - Switch heuristics if current ones yield diminishing returns or if specific constraints need addressing (e.g., switch from efficiency improvement to deadline-sensitive if deadline compliance drops).\n   - Document results and learning from each iteration to inform future heuristic selection.\n\n### Considerations for Heuristic Selection\n- **Data Characteristics**: Understand key data features (e.g., average production rates, deadline variance) to tailor heuristic choice.\n- **Solution Feedback**: Use feedback from solution evaluations to guide heuristic adjustments.\n- **Diverse Approaches**: Avoid over-reliance on a single heuristic category. Balance between construction and improvement-focused heuristics to explore different optimization paths.\n\nThis strategic guide serves as a flexible framework for navigating the complex landscape of the DPOSP problem, allowing for adaptive and informed heuristic selection throughout the solution process."
