I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id

        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        new_schedule[self.production_line_id].append(self.order_id)
        return Solution(new_schedule)

        return Solution(new_schedule)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):

        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            if start_index > end_index:
                (start_index, end_index) = (end_index, start_index)
            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making a sequence of decisions (scheduling orders on production lines) under constraints (e.g., deadlines, transition times, production speeds), with the objective of maximizing the number of completed orders. This type of problem can be addressed using heuristic methods, as heuristics are well-suited for finding good-enough solutions to complex combinatorial problems where exact solutions are computationally expensive or infeasible. The framework you have built, with the Solution and Operator classes, provides a flexible structure for applying various heuristic algorithms.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To effectively apply the heuristics you have implemented for the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP), it's crucial to understand the scenarios or contexts where each heuristic might perform best. Here is an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for situations where the initial production schedule is suboptimal, and there is room for improvement by rearranging the order of production. It is particularly effective when there are significant transition times or when production rates vary widely across orders.
   - **Quantified by**: A high degree of variability in production speeds and transition times, along with the presence of non-critical orders that can be easily swapped without compromising deadlines.

2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there is a high number of orders with varying deadlines and production requirements, making it crucial to prioritize orders that can be completed promptly without affecting future scheduling. It is beneficial in environments with tight deadlines and resource constraints.
   - **Quantified by**: A large volume of orders with diverse deadline tightness and production feasibility, requiring an efficient prioritization mechanism.

3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for production lines where the sequence of orders can be optimized by swapping non-adjacent orders. This heuristic is effective when the production line has flexibility in the order sequence and when minimizing total production and transition time is critical.
   - **Quantified by**: The presence of production lines with non-fixed order sequences and the potential for reduced production time through re-sequencing.

4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in environments where short production times are prioritized, and the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by dynamically adjusting the schedule. It is effective when deadlines are tight, and continuous optimization is necessary.
   - **Quantified by**: A high number of short-duration orders with tight deadlines, where quick adjustments and optimizations can yield significant benefits.

5. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**
   - **Scenario**: Best used in situations where maximizing the number of fulfilled orders is critical, and there is a need to prioritize orders that are close to their deadlines. This heuristic is beneficial when there are many competing orders with similar feasibility.
   - **Quantified by**: A large set of orders with closely approaching deadlines, necessitating a focus on maximizing completion rates.

6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when there is flexibility in moving orders between production lines to optimize overall production efficiency. It is particularly useful when some lines are underutilized, or when certain orders cannot be completed on their current line due to constraints.
   - **Quantified by**: A scenario with multiple production lines and varying levels of line utilization, allowing for the beneficial redistribution of orders.

By understanding these scenarios and associated quantifiers, you can better decide when to apply each heuristic for optimal performance in the DPOSP.
