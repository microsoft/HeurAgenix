                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines.

Here is an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is well-suited for situations where the initial production schedule is suboptimal, and there is room for improvement by rearranging the order of production. It is particularly effective when there are significant transition times or when production rates vary widely across orders.\n   - **Quantified by**: A high degree of variability in production speeds and transition times, along with the presence of non-critical orders that can be easily swapped without compromising deadlines.\n\n2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there is a high number of orders with varying deadlines and production requirements, making it crucial to prioritize orders that can be completed promptly without affecting future scheduling. It is beneficial in environments with tight deadlines and resource constraints.\n   - **Quantified by**: A large volume of orders with diverse deadline tightness and production feasibility, requiring an efficient prioritization mechanism.\n\n3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for production lines where the sequence of orders can be optimized by swapping non-adjacent orders. This heuristic is effective when the production line has flexibility in the order sequence and when minimizing total production and transition time is critical.\n   - **Quantified by**: The presence of production lines with non-fixed order sequences and the potential for reduced production time through re-sequencing.\n\n4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in environments where short production times are prioritized, and the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by dynamically adjusting the schedule. It is effective when deadlines are tight, and continuous optimization is necessary.\n   - **Quantified by**: A high number of short-duration orders with tight deadlines, where quick adjustments and optimizations can yield significant benefits.\n\n5. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**\n   - **Scenario**: Best used in situations where maximizing the number of fulfilled orders is critical, and there is a need to prioritize orders that are close to their deadlines. This heuristic is beneficial when there are many competing orders with similar feasibility.\n   - **Quantified by**: A large set of orders with closely approaching deadlines, necessitating a focus on maximizing completion rates.\n\n6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when there is flexibility in moving orders between production lines to optimize overall production efficiency. It is particularly useful when some lines are underutilized, or when certain orders cannot be completed on their current line due to constraints.\n   - **Quantified by**: A scenario with multiple production lines and varying levels of line utilization, allowing for the beneficial redistribution of orders.\n\nBy understanding these scenarios and associated quantifiers, you can better decide when to apply each heuristic for optimal performance in the DPOSP."

This will lay a foundation for further improvement with other heuristics.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 10.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -274\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Shift focus to improving the current sequence on production lines to potentially reduce total time cost and improve the fulfillment ratio by optimizing the order sequence.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: We should switch back to a constructive heuristic to increase the number of fulfilled orders, leveraging the current feasible order pool and focusing on maximizing order fulfillment. This step will help balance the construction and optimization of the schedule.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 13.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -518\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 5\nExplain: Since the last heuristic was constructive, we now focus on improving the current solution's efficiency by optimizing the order sequence within production lines.

This will help to increase the number of fulfilled orders by constructing the solution further, leveraging the current feasible order pool. The goal is to maximize order fulfillment while maintaining feasibility.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -339\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
