I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

        return Solution(new_schedule)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a segment of orders within a production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            if start_index > end_index:
                (start_index, end_index) = (end_index, start_index)
            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Moves an order from one position to another within the same or to a different production line."""
    def __init__(self, source_production_line_id: int, source_position: int, target_production_line_id: int, target_position: int):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

Understood. You're working on the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP), which involves scheduling production orders on multiple machines with the objective of maximizing the number of completed orders before their deadlines. You've provided a formal optimization model with decision variables, input variables, intermediate variables, and an objective function with constraints.

Additionally, you've created a framework to facilitate the application of heuristic algorithms to this problem. This framework includes a `Solution` class to represent production schedules and several `BaseOperator` subclasses such as `AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSegmentOperator`, `RelocateOperator`, and `MergeOperator` to modify solutions.

You also described a standardized heuristic function signature that takes various data inputs, including global static information, current dynamic state data, and algorithm-specific data, and outputs a tuple consisting of an operator instance and an updated algorithm data dictionary.

I have committed to memory the description of the DPOSP, the optimization model, and the structure of your framework. We can proceed to discuss the challenges you're encountering in the next conversation.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic to the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves understanding the strengths and ideal conditions for each heuristic. Let's consider the scenarios and quantify the conditions where each algorithm might be most effective:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2**: 
   - Applicable when the current schedule is near-optimal, and small adjustments could lead to improvements.
   - Best when there is a high variance in production and transition times, allowing for beneficial swaps.
   - Quantification: High standard deviation in production/transition times across orders.

2. **farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a**: 
   - Applicable when the schedule has flexibility towards the end, with fewer orders near their deadlines.
   - Best when there's a significant difference between the earliest and latest deadlines.
   - Quantification: Large range between the earliest and latest order deadlines.

3. **greedy_by_order_density_c702**:
   - Applicable when orders vary significantly in value and production/transition times.
   - Best when there is a mix of high-value, quick-to-produce orders and lower-value, longer orders.
   - Quantification: High coefficient of variation in order density across orders.

4. **greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e**:
   - Applicable in early stages or when many orders have similar deadlines, allowing for efficient sequencing.
   - Best when deadlines are spread evenly over the planning horizon.
   - Quantification: Low standard deviation in the time remaining until order deadlines.

5. **greedy_order_selection_2882**:
   - Applicable in various scenarios, particularly when orders are similar in production time and value.
   - Best when criteria for selection (e.g., deadline, processing time) are clear and distinct.
   - Quantification: High correlation between selected criteria (e.g., deadline) and order priority.

6. **least_order_remaining_9c3c**:
   - Applicable when the schedule needs to be balanced with shorter tasks to fill gaps.
   - Best when there's a significant variation in remaining work among unfulfilled orders.
   - Quantification: High standard deviation in remaining processing time across orders.

7. **longest_order_next_c9cb**:
   - Applicable when there are few very long orders that could significantly impact the schedule.
   - Best when there are clear gaps in the schedule that can accommodate long orders without affecting others.
   - Quantification: Presence of outlier orders with processing times significantly above the average.

8. **maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c**:
   - Applicable when focusing on completing the most time-consuming tasks to reduce future schedule risk.
   - Best when there is a significant variation in the remaining work of unfulfilled orders.
   - Quantification: High variance in the remaining work (time) required for unfulfilled orders.

9. **nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e**:
   - Applicable when the schedule is relatively empty or in the initial stages of scheduling.
   - Best when transition times are critical and orders have varying deadlines.
   - Quantification: High variation in transition times between consecutive orders.

10. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c**:
    - Applicable when production lines are specialized, and some orders may be better suited for other lines.
    - Best when there's an imbalance in the workload across production lines.
    - Quantification: Significant discrepancies in total time cost per production line.

11. **random_c05a**:
    - Applicable as a diversification strategy in a larger metaheuristic or when other heuristics are stuck.
    - Best when the solution space is vast, and other heuristics have not converged.
    - Quantification: Number of feasible insertion points for orders relative to the size of the solution space.

12. **shortest_operation_time_first_e891**:
    - Applicable when the schedule needs to be filled with quick tasks to optimize machine utilization.
    - Best when there's a significant variation in operation times across orders.
    - Quantification: High variance in processing times for unfulfilled orders.

13. **shortest_order_next_25bd**:
    - Applicable in scenarios similar to the shortest operation time first, focusing on quick wins.
    - Best when there's a clear advantage to completing short orders to free up capacity.
    - Quantification: Low average processing time for unfulfilled orders relative to available production time.

14. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e**:
    - Applicable when the current schedule is sub-optimal, and there are potential gains from reordering.
    - Best when the current sequence of orders has high transition times that can be reduced.
    - Quantification: High average transition time between scheduled orders on production lines.

In practice, the best heuristic(s) to use may depend on a combination of these quantifiable scenarios. A metaheuristic approach could be employed to dynamically choose the most suitable heuristic based on the current state of the schedule and the characteristics of the remaining unfulfilled orders.
