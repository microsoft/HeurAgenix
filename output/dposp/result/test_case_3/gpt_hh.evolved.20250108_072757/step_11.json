                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

Here is a breakdown of the scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**: \n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where the production schedule is reasonably well-optimized, but there are inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequences. It is particularly effective when small changes, like swapping non-adjacent orders, can lead to significant improvements in meeting deadlines or reducing transition times.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: High variability in production speeds and transition times, and a moderate number of orders with flexible deadlines.\n\n2. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when there are many orders with close deadlines, and the challenge is to prioritize which orders to complete first. It is effective in environments where orders have varying levels of urgency and feasibility.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: High density of orders with tight deadlines and varying production feasibility across lines.\n\n3. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when there is an imbalance in the load among production lines, and some orders remain unfulfilled due to line-specific constraints. It is ideal when there is flexibility in moving orders between lines without compromising deadlines.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Significant variance in production line capabilities and unfulfilled orders due to line-specific constraints.\n\n4. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where there is a need to quickly prioritize orders based on a combination of urgency, feasibility, and flexibility. It works well when orders can be dynamically reprioritized without causing significant disruptions.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Environments with a high number of orders and frequent changes in order priorities or constraints.\n\n5. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Similar to the first heuristic, this is useful for fine-tuning the order sequence within a production line. It is most effective when initial schedules are feasible but not optimal, and there is room to improve efficiency by reordering.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: Stable production schedules with potential for optimization by minor adjustments in order sequencing.\n\n6. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for maximizing fulfilled orders in environments with tight deadlines and varying production times. This heuristic is beneficial when order deadlines are critical, and there is a need for continuous optimization through shifting and swapping.\n   - **Best Quantified By**: High urgency in fulfilling orders with varying production times and frequent opportunities for re-optimization.\n\nIn summary, each heuristic addresses different aspects of the scheduling problem, from optimizing order sequences to dynamically prioritizing and shifting orders across production lines. Their applicability depends on the specific constraints and characteristics of the production environment, such as production line capabilities, order deadlines, and transition times."

Using the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic is suitable at this stage as it is a constructive heuristic that prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. This will help us create a baseline solution by attempting to fulfill as many orders as possible initially.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 10.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -274\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The 2-opt heuristic is chosen to improve the current production schedule by optimizing the sequence of orders within each production line. This will help reduce total production and transition time, thereby increasing the number of fulfilled orders.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the current state where the fulfillment ratio is 0.1 and there's a significant number of unfulfilled orders, focusing on shifting orders between production lines might help balance the load and improve fulfillment without constructing a new solution from scratch. This heuristic is particularly useful when production line capabilities vary and some lines may have idle capacity that can be utilized.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: With a large number of unfulfilled orders and a low fulfillment ratio, applying a constructive heuristic will help in building the solution further. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic will prioritize unfulfilled orders based on deadlines and feasibility, aiming to increase the number of fulfilled orders.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 13.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -518\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic will focus on optimizing the sequence of orders within each production line. Given the constructive work done by `shortest_operation_ae31`, this step will aim to refine the schedule, reduce time costs, and increase the number of fulfilled orders by improving the efficiency of the current order sequences.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: Given the low fulfillment ratio and the fact that the last step was an improvement heuristic, using a constructive heuristic like shortest_operation_ae31 will help in building the solution further by prioritizing unfulfilled orders and potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders. This approach will constructively add to the solution and prepare it for further refinement.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -339\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The current state has a low fulfillment ratio of 0.3, and applying the `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic will focus on optimizing the order sequences within production lines. This is expected to improve the efficiency of the schedule by reducing time costs, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders, and enhancing the overall solution quality.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The current fulfillment ratio is low, and there are many unfulfilled orders. Applying the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help build the solution by prioritizing unfulfilled orders based on deadlines and feasibility, aiming to increase the number of fulfilled orders.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -420\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic is selected to improve the current solution by optimizing the order sequences within each production line. This is expected to enhance the efficiency of the schedule by reducing time costs and increasing the fulfillment ratio.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 9---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 10\nExplain: The fulfillment ratio is still low at 0.4, and there are many unfulfilled orders. Applying the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help in constructing the solution further by prioritizing unfulfilled orders based on deadlines and feasibility, aiming to increase the number of fulfilled orders.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -663\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n---Round 10---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: Since the last heuristic used was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31), the next logical step is to apply an improvement heuristic. The _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e is chosen to optimize the sequence of orders within each production line, aiming to enhance efficiency and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders. This approach will help refine the existing solution by reducing time costs and improving order sequences.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
