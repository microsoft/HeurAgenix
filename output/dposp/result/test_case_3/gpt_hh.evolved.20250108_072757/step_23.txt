I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves making decisions about the sequence of orders on multiple production lines, considering constraints like production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. Such problems are typically characterized by a large search space and discrete variables, making them suitable for heuristic approaches. The framework you have built with the Solution and Operator classes aligns well with heuristic methods, which often rely on constructing and modifying solutions iteratively to improve performance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios for each heuristic involves understanding the characteristics of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) and identifying the conditions where each heuristic could be most effective. Here is a breakdown of the scenarios where each heuristic might be applicable:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**: 
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where the production schedule is reasonably well-optimized, but there are inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequences. It is particularly effective when small changes, like swapping non-adjacent orders, can lead to significant improvements in meeting deadlines or reducing transition times.
   - **Best Quantified By**: High variability in production speeds and transition times, and a moderate number of orders with flexible deadlines.

2. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used when there are many orders with close deadlines, and the challenge is to prioritize which orders to complete first. It is effective in environments where orders have varying levels of urgency and feasibility.
   - **Best Quantified By**: High density of orders with tight deadlines and varying production feasibility across lines.

3. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when there is an imbalance in the load among production lines, and some orders remain unfulfilled due to line-specific constraints. It is ideal when there is flexibility in moving orders between lines without compromising deadlines.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Significant variance in production line capabilities and unfulfilled orders due to line-specific constraints.

4. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in situations where there is a need to quickly prioritize orders based on a combination of urgency, feasibility, and flexibility. It works well when orders can be dynamically reprioritized without causing significant disruptions.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Environments with a high number of orders and frequent changes in order priorities or constraints.

5. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:
   - **Scenario**: Similar to the first heuristic, this is useful for fine-tuning the order sequence within a production line. It is most effective when initial schedules are feasible but not optimal, and there is room to improve efficiency by reordering.
   - **Best Quantified By**: Stable production schedules with potential for optimization by minor adjustments in order sequencing.

6. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for maximizing fulfilled orders in environments with tight deadlines and varying production times. This heuristic is beneficial when order deadlines are critical, and there is a need for continuous optimization through shifting and swapping.
   - **Best Quantified By**: High urgency in fulfilling orders with varying production times and frequent opportunities for re-optimization.

In summary, each heuristic addresses different aspects of the scheduling problem, from optimizing order sequences to dynamically prioritizing and shifting orders across production lines. Their applicability depends on the specific constraints and characteristics of the production environment, such as production line capabilities, order deadlines, and transition times.

Before this discuss, we have already 23 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Since the current fulfillment ratio is 0.0 and all orders are unfulfilled, it indicates that we need to construct an initial solution.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.
