I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves decision-making over discrete and finite configurations, such as the assignment of orders to production lines, sequence of operations, and scheduling within constraints. The problem is characterized by the need to optimize the arrangement and timing of operations across multiple machines while adhering to constraints like production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. These features align well with combinatorial optimization challenges, where heuristic algorithms can be effectively employed to explore the solution space and find near-optimal solutions. Your framework, including the definition of operators and the heuristic function signature, is structured to support heuristic approaches, making it suitable for tackling such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm would be most applicable involves understanding the specific characteristics and constraints of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP). Each heuristic has strengths that make it suitable for particular situations based on the nature of the orders, production lines, and constraints involved. Here's an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **Least Order Remaining (27ca):**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is ideal when the order deadlines are tight, and it's crucial to prioritize completion of orders that are closest to their deadlines. It is particularly effective when there is a high potential for maximizing the number of fulfilled orders with minimal adjustments.
   - **Quantification:** Effective when the ratio of orders nearing their deadlines to total orders is high, or when the variance in order deadlines is small, making deadline proximity a crucial factor.

2. **Exchange Production Orders (eda2):**
   - **Scenario:** Best used when there is flexibility in the order sequence, and there is a need to optimize the production schedule by reducing production and transition times. It's useful in scenarios where production lines have variable speeds, and swapping orders can lead to significant improvements.
   - **Quantification:** Applicable when the average transition time between orders is high, or when there is a wide range of production speeds across different lines.

3. **Greedy by Order Density (de77):**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable when a quick, greedy approach can suffice to prioritize orders based on a balance of deadline tightness and production feasibility. It's effective in environments with moderate constraints where simple heuristics can achieve close-to-optimal results.
   - **Quantification:** Works well when the density of orders (orders per production line) is high, and deadlines are moderately distributed.

4. **2-opt Production Sequence (8e5e):**
   - **Scenario:** This heuristic is applicable when there is a need to explore alternative sequences on production lines for efficiency improvements. It is suitable in scenarios where order sequences can be rearranged without violating deadlines, similar to optimization in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
   - **Quantification:** Best applied when the number of orders per line is large, and there is significant variability in production rates and transition times that can benefit from sequence optimization.

5. **Shortest Operation (ae31):**
   - **Scenario:** Most effective when production times are a critical constraint and the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by minimizing the time spent on each operation. It's ideal in environments where quick adjustments and optimizations are needed.
   - **Quantification:** Useful when the average production time per order is high, and there is a significant difference in production times across orders.

6. **Order Shift Between Lines (bd0c):**
   - **Scenario:** Applicable in situations where production lines have different capabilities, and shifting orders can lead to better resource utilization. It's particularly relevant when some production lines are underutilized, and others are overburdened.
   - **Quantification:** Effective when there is a high disparity in the workload across production lines, and the transition costs between lines are low enough to justify the shift.

Each heuristic has its strengths and is tailored to address specific aspects of the DPOSP. The key to effective application lies in understanding the problem's characteristics and selecting the heuristic that best aligns with the current constraints and objectives.

Before this discuss, we have already 10 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given that we are at the initial stage with no fulfilled orders and a full list of unfulfilled orders, it is prudent to start with a constructive heuristic like `shortest_operation_ae31`. This heuristic is well-suited for building an initial solution by prioritizing orders based on deadlines and production times. The goal is to construct a baseline schedule that maximizes the number of fulfilled orders. Once a foundation is established, we can subsequently apply improvement heuristics to optimize the solution further.

The shortest_operation_ae31 is selected to potentially introduce new order placements and maximize fulfilled orders based on deadlines and production times. This approach aligns with the strategy to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics, ensuring a balanced exploration of the solution space.

The `exchange_production_orders_eda2` will help explore potential optimizations in the current schedule by swapping orders. This aims to increase the fulfillment ratio and potentially reduce time costs without significantly altering the overall structure. This approach aligns with the strategy to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics, ensuring a balanced exploration of the solution space.

Explain: Given that the last heuristic applied was an improvement heuristic (exchange_production_orders_eda2) and did not yield any further improvements, it is advisable to switch back to a constructive heuristic. The shortest_operation_ae31 is selected to potentially introduce new order placements and maximize fulfilled orders based on deadlines and production times. This approach aligns with the strategy to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics, ensuring a balanced exploration of the solution space.

Explain: Given that the last heuristic applied was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31) and resulted in a decrease in the number of fulfilled orders, it is strategic to switch to an improvement heuristic. The `exchange_production_orders_eda2` will help explore potential optimizations in the current schedule by swapping orders. This aims to increase the fulfillment ratio and potentially reduce time costs without significantly altering the overall structure. This approach aligns with the strategy to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics, ensuring a balanced exploration of the solution space.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: exchange_production_orders_eda2. How does exchange_production_orders_eda2 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current scenario and the application of improvement heuristics without further improvements in fulfilled orders, it is strategic to switch back to a constructive heuristic. The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic can be used to potentially introduce new order placements and maximize fulfilled orders based on deadlines and production times. This approach aligns with the strategy to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
running steps: 10
explanation: Since the last heuristic applied was an improvement heuristic (exchange_production_orders_eda2) that did not yield any further improvements in the number of fulfilled orders, switching back to a constructive heuristic is advisable. The `shortest_operation_ae31` is selected to explore new order placements and maximize fulfilled orders, especially given that there are still unfulfilled orders and room for improvement in the current solution.
