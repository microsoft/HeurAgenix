I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id
        self.order_id = order_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        new_schedule[self.production_line_id].append(self.order_id)
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class InsertOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Inserts an order at a specified position within a production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int, position: int):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.position = position
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        new_schedule[self.production_line_id].insert(self.position, self.order_id)
        return Solution(new_schedule)

    """Swaps two orders between or within production lines."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id1: int, position1: int, production_line_id2: int, position2: int):
        if production_line_id1 <= production_line_id2:
            self.production_line_id1 = production_line_id1
            self.position1 = position1
            self.production_line_id2 = production_line_id2
            self.position2 = position2
        else:
            self.production_line_id1 = production_line_id2

            self.position2 = position1
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        (new_schedule[self.production_line_id1][self.position1], new_schedule[self.production_line_id2][self.position2]) = (new_schedule[self.production_line_id2][self.position2], new_schedule[self.production_line_id1][self.position1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a segment of orders within a production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            if start_index > end_index:
                (start_index, end_index) = (end_index, start_index)
            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Moves an order from one position to another within the same or to a different production line."""
    def __init__(self, source_production_line_id: int, source_position: int, target_production_line_id: int, target_position: int):
        self.source_production_line_id = source_production_line_id
        self.source_position = source_position

class MergeOperator(BaseOperator):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves decision-making over discrete and finite configurations, such as the assignment of orders to production lines, sequence of operations, and scheduling within constraints. The problem is characterized by the need to optimize the arrangement and timing of operations across multiple machines while adhering to constraints like production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. These features align well with combinatorial optimization challenges, where heuristic algorithms can be effectively employed to explore the solution space and find near-optimal solutions. Your framework, including the definition of operators and the heuristic function signature, is structured to support heuristic approaches, making it suitable for tackling such problems.
