I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves determining an optimal sequence of operations (production actions) across multiple machines, subject to a set of constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. The objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, which aligns with typical goals in combinatorial optimization where a discrete set of solutions is explored to find the best one.

Heuristics are a common approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems, especially when they are complex and computationally expensive to solve exactly. The operators you've defined (Append, Insert, Swap, ReverseSegment, Relocate, and Merge) are suitable for manipulating the solution space in a heuristic framework, allowing for various search strategies to explore and optimize the order schedules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To analyze the applicability and quantification of scenarios for each heuristic, we need to consider the specific characteristics and constraints of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) that each heuristic addresses. Here's a breakdown:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable for scenarios where the order of production significantly impacts transition times and production efficiency. It is especially useful when there are many orders with varying deadlines and production speeds.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when the production schedule has room for improvement in terms of transition time reduction and when swapping orders can lead to a more favorable schedule without violating deadlines.

2. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when there is a need to prioritize orders based on urgency (proximity to deadlines) and feasibility. It is ideal for environments with tight deadlines and varying order importance.
   - **Quantification**: Most effective when there is a high volume of orders with varying deadlines, and it is critical to maximize the number of completed orders.

3. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable when certain production lines have excess capacity or when some lines are underutilized. It is useful in balancing workloads across production lines.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when there are significant discrepancies in production line loads or when certain orders cannot be completed on their current line due to constraints.

4. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in scenarios where orders have varying levels of difficulty to schedule, and there is a need to prioritize based on a combination of deadline tightness and production feasibility.
   - **Quantification**: Useful when there is a mix of easy and difficult-to-schedule orders, and it is important to maintain flexibility for future scheduling decisions.

5. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable for improving the sequence of orders within a production line when there is a potential for reducing transition times through re-sequencing.
   - **Quantification**: Best applied when there are many non-adjacent orders that, if swapped, could lead to a more efficient sequence, especially when deadlines are not overly restrictive.

6. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for environments where operations vary greatly in duration and where it's crucial to optimize the schedule dynamically based on order characteristics.
   - **Quantification**: Most effective when the goal is to maximize fulfilled orders by dynamically adapting to changing conditions, such as new orders or shifts in production capabilities.

In summary, the applicability of each heuristic depends on the specific constraints and objectives of the production environment. The best heuristic to apply will vary based on factors such as order volume, deadline strictness, production line capabilities, and the potential for schedule improvement through order re-sequencing or shifting.

Before this discuss, we have already 0 rounds discuss and the summary are:
None

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: None. How does None perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Given the current state data and the fact that no orders have been fulfilled yet, it is critical to start constructing a solution. Since we are at the beginning of the process, utilizing a constructive heuristic would be appropriate to establish a baseline schedule. The **shortest_operation_ae31** heuristic is a suitable choice for initial construction due to its focus on maximizing fulfilled orders by prioritizing based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
running steps: 10
explanation: Since no orders are currently fulfilled, we need to construct an initial solution. The shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help to quickly start fulfilling orders by focusing on those that are feasible and have shorter operation times, thereby improving the initial fulfillment ratio.
