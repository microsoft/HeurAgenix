I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) as you have described it is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. This is because it involves making a series of discrete decisions (scheduling orders on production lines) with the aim of optimizing a particular objective (maximizing the number of completed orders by their deadlines). The problem deals with constraints like machine capabilities, transition times, and deadlines, which are typical in combinatorial optimization problems.

The use of heuristics is appropriate for solving such problems, especially when they are complex and traditional optimization methods may be computationally expensive. The framework you have developed, with a structured solution and operator design, supports the application of heuristic algorithms well. The operators you have described allow for modifications to the solution, which is a key aspect of implementing heuristic methods effectively.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing the applicability of each heuristic requires understanding the specific characteristics of the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) and how each heuristic attempts to optimize the scheduling. Here are the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable:

1. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**
   - **Scenario:** Useful when orders have varied deadlines and production times, and there's a need to quickly identify orders that can be completed feasibly within the remaining time.
   - **Quantification:** Best used when there's a high variance in deadlines and production times across orders.

2. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**
   - **Scenario:** Effective in optimizing existing schedules by reducing total production and transition times through order swaps.
   - **Quantification:** Applicable when the current schedule is near-optimal but could benefit from minor adjustments to improve efficiency.

3. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**
   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes orders that offer the best balance between tight deadlines and ease of production.
   - **Quantification:** Useful in environments where deadlines are tight and production feasibility varies widely.

4. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable for refining production sequences on individual lines by considering swaps that respect deadlines.
   - **Quantification:** Best used when sequence adjustments can lead to significant improvements in schedule feasibility.

5. **shortest_operation_ae31()**
   - **Scenario:** Prioritizes orders with the shortest operations to quickly maximize the number of completed orders.
   - **Quantification:** Ideal for scenarios with many small orders and relatively uniform deadlines.

6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**
   - **Scenario:** Useful for balancing workloads across production lines by shifting orders.
   - **Quantification:** Applicable when production lines have uneven workloads or capabilities.

7. **longest_order_next_c9cb()**
   - **Scenario:** Focuses on scheduling long operations effectively without disrupting overall schedule feasibility.
   - **Quantification:** Useful when there are few, but long, orders that need careful placement in the schedule.

8. **random_c05a(max_attempts)**
   - **Scenario:** Introduces randomness to explore diverse scheduling configurations, useful in early stages or when other heuristics fail.
   - **Quantification:** Applicable when there's no clear optimal strategy or in highly dynamic environments.

9. **farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a()**
   - **Scenario:** Focuses on orders with distant deadlines, ensuring they are scheduled in a minimally disruptive manner.
   - **Quantification:** Best used when there are many orders with far-off deadlines that could otherwise be neglected.

10. **maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c()**
    - **Scenario:** Targets orders with the most remaining work, aiming to maximize throughput of large orders.
    - **Quantification:** Useful when large orders dominate the workload and need to be scheduled efficiently.

11. **greedy_order_selection_2882()**
    - **Scenario:** Builds schedules by iteratively selecting the best available order based on a simple heuristic.
    - **Quantification:** Applicable in straightforward scenarios where one criterion, like shortest processing time, can drive scheduling decisions.

12. **greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e()**
    - **Scenario:** Prioritizes orders nearing their deadlines, effective for ensuring timely completions.
    - **Quantification:** Best used in deadline-sensitive environments where missing a deadline has significant consequences.

13. **nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e()**
    - **Scenario:** Builds schedules by minimizing setup times between consecutive orders.
    - **Quantification:** Ideal when transition times dominate the scheduling problem, and efficiency gains can be made by minimizing these times.

14. **shortest_order_next_25bd()**
    - **Scenario:** Focuses on quickly completing the shortest orders, maximizing the number of finished tasks.
    - **Quantification:** Useful when quick wins are needed, and many short orders are present.

These scenarios provide a framework for deciding when to apply each heuristic based on the characteristics of the orders, production lines, and the overarching scheduling objectives.

---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Given that all orders are unfulfilled and the fulfillment ratio is currently 0, a constructive heuristic that prioritizes orders based on deadline proximity is appropriate. This will help in quickly building a feasible schedule by focusing on orders that are closest to their deadlines, thereby maximizing initial order completions within the tight constraints.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 99.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1225
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 44
---Round 1---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Given that the last heuristic used was a constructive heuristic (greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e), it's now appropriate to use an optimization-focused heuristic like 2-opt to refine the existing solution. The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic is suitable for this stage as it can explore potential improvements in the order sequence on each production line, which may lead to a better overall schedule by minimizing transition times and ensuring order deadlines are met. Running this heuristic for 50 steps should provide sufficient exploration of possible sequence optimizations.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 40
Explain: Switching to a constructive heuristic like farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a will help explore additional opportunities to fulfill unfulfilled orders by considering those with the farthest deadlines. Running it for 40 steps should provide a good balance between exploration and maintaining the current solution's feasibility.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Since the last heuristic used was a constructive one (farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a), it's time to apply an optimization-focused heuristic to refine the existing solution further. The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic is appropriate here as it seeks to improve the order sequence on each production line, potentially minimizing transition times and enhancing overall schedule efficiency. Running it for 50 steps should provide a thorough exploration of possible sequence improvements.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 40
Explain: Since the last used heuristic was _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e with no improvement, switching to a constructive heuristic will help explore scheduling possibilities for unfulfilled orders with far deadlines. Running it for 40 steps provides a balanced exploration.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 5---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Since the last heuristic was a constructive one and did not yield improvements, running the 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic for 50 steps can help in refining the order sequence on each production line. This may lead to improvements in overall efficiency by minimizing transition times, potentially opening up opportunities for any remaining feasible orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 6---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 40
Explain: Since the last heuristic used was the optimization-focused _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e and no improvements were observed, switching to a constructive heuristic like farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a may help explore scheduling possibilities for the remaining unfulfilled orders with far deadlines. Running this heuristic for 40 steps can provide a balanced exploration of potential solutions that may improve the fulfillment ratio or unlock feasible orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 7---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Since the last heuristic used was farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a, which is a constructive heuristic, we will now apply the optimization-focused 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic. This heuristic aims to refine the existing solution by improving the order sequence on each production line, potentially reducing transition times and enhancing overall schedule efficiency. Given that the previous rounds have not yielded improvements, running this heuristic for 50 steps could help explore sequence optimizations that might unlock further improvements.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as farthest_insertion_54db) 30/40/50 or 100 steps and then 3opt 50 steps as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run 3opt 50 steps.
If last heuristic is 3opt 50 steps,we run 3opt 50 steps  constructive heuristic (such as farthest_insertion_54db) for  30/40/50 or 100 steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
running steps: 40
explanation: Given that the last heuristic used was an optimization-focused one (_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e) and no improvements were observed, it's appropriate to switch to a constructive heuristic. The farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a heuristic will explore opportunities to schedule the remaining unfulfilled orders with the farthest deadlines. Running this for 40 steps provides a balanced opportunity to potentially increase the fulfillment ratio or identify new feasible orders.
