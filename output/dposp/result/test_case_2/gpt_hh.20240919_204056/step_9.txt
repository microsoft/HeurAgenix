I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

    def __init__(self, source_production_line_id: int, source_position: int, target_production_line_id: int, target_position: int):

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Sure! Let's analyze the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is applicable and identify the best quantifiable scenarios for each:

### 1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when the current schedule has potential inefficiencies due to suboptimal ordering of tasks. It is particularly effective when:
- There are many orders, and the current schedule is far from optimal.
- There are significant variations in production speeds and transition times.
- Orders have flexible deadlines.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High total production time, high total transition time, and a relatively high number of unfulfilled orders.

### 2. `farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a`
**Scenario**: This heuristic works best when the focus is on scheduling orders that have longer deadlines, ensuring that orders with closer deadlines are left for future iterations. It is effective when:
- Most orders have far deadlines, and a few have closer deadlines.
- Transition times are relatively low.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High number of unfulfilled orders with far deadlines, low to moderate transition times.

### 3. `greedy_by_order_density_c702`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there is a need to maximize the efficiency of the schedule by prioritizing orders that offer the best ratio of value (e.g., fulfillment) to time cost. It is effective when:
- There are significant differences in production rates and transition times.
- Orders can be easily compared based on their "density."
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High variability in production rates and transition times, moderate to high number of unfulfilled orders.

### 4. `greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when there are many orders with deadlines, and the goal is to prioritize those with the closest deadlines. It is effective when:
- Orders have a wide range of deadlines.
- Transition times are not prohibitively high.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High number of orders with varying deadlines, low to moderate transition times.

### 5. `greedy_order_selection_2882`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is a general-purpose greedy algorithm that works well when a simple criterion like closest deadline or shortest processing time can guide the scheduling. It is effective when:
- The problem is not too complex or when a quick solution is needed.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: Moderate number of orders, moderate deadlines, and transition times.

### 6. `least_order_remaining_9c3c`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there are many small orders, and the goal is to quickly complete the least remaining work. It is effective when:
- There are many small orders.
- Production lines can handle frequent transitions.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High number of small orders, low to moderate transition times.

### 7. `longest_order_next_c9cb`
**Scenario**: This heuristic works best when there are a few large orders that need to be prioritized. It is effective when:
- There are a few large orders with significant processing times.
- Deadlines are not very tight.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: Low to moderate number of large orders, moderate to high production times.

### 8. `maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when the goal is to maximize the amount of work done within the constraints. It is effective when:
- Orders have varying amounts of work.
- The production line capacity can handle large orders.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High variability in order sizes, moderate to high production capacities.

### 9. `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for minimizing transition times by selecting the next closest order in terms of setup time. It is effective when:
- Transition times are significant.
- Orders are relatively close in terms of required transitions.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High transition times, moderate number of orders with close transition requirements.

### 10. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable when there is an imbalance in the load across production lines and shifting orders can improve overall efficiency. It is effective when:
- Some production lines are underutilized while others are overloaded.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High imbalance in production line loads, moderate to high number of orders.

### 11. `random_c05a`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is useful for generating initial solutions or escaping local optima in other heuristics. It is effective when:
- The solution space needs to be explored randomly.
- There is no clear heuristic that outperforms others initially.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High diversity in possible solutions, need for stochastic exploration.

### 12. `shortest_operation_time_first_e891`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when orders have short processing times and the goal is to quickly complete as many orders as possible. It is effective when:
- There are many small orders with short processing times.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High number of small orders, low production times.

### 13. `shortest_order_next_25bd`
**Scenario**: Similar to the previous heuristic, this is useful when the goal is to complete the shortest orders first. It is effective when:
- There are many small orders.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High number of small orders, low production times.

### 14. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`
**Scenario**: This heuristic is useful for optimizing the sequence of orders within a production line, similar to the 2-opt approach in TSP. It is effective when:
- The current sequence is suboptimal, and there is room for improvement.
- Orders have flexible deadlines.
**Quantifiable Scenario**: High total production and transition times, high number of unfulfilled orders.

By understanding these scenarios and their quantifiable characteristics, you can better decide which heuristic to apply based on the specific problem instance you are dealing with.

Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Starting with the `greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e` heuristic will allow us to quickly build an initial feasible solution by prioritizing orders with the closest deadlines. This will help us establish a baseline schedule, which we can further refine using other heuristics in subsequent steps.

Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 5
---Round 1---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_c702
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The `greedy_by_order_density_c702` heuristic will help us identify and schedule orders that offer the best value to time cost ratio, improving the overall efficiency of the production schedule. Given the high number of unfulfilled orders and the need to better utilize production lines, this heuristic is a suitable choice for the next 10 steps.

---Round 2---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Applying the `exchange_production_orders_eda2` heuristic will help us optimize the current order sequence by swapping non-adjacent orders. This could improve the overall efficiency and potentially increase the number of feasible orders for future fulfillment. Given the current imbalance in production line utilization and the reduction in feasible orders, this heuristic is a suitable choice for the next 5 steps.

Heuristic: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Applying the `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e` heuristic will help minimize transition times and schedule orders based on their proximity to delivery deadlines. This is expected to balance the load across production lines and increase the number of fulfilled orders. Given the significant reduction in feasible orders and the need to improve the fulfillment ratio, this heuristic is a suitable choice for the next 10 steps.

---Round 5---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Given the moderate deadline variance and the reduction in incremental gains from `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`, the `farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a` heuristic is expected to provide a balanced approach by scheduling orders with far deadlines. This will help in improving the overall schedule and increasing the fulfillment ratio.

Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -144
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 5
---Round 6---
Heuristic: greedy_order_selection_2882
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the reduction in feasible orders from the previous heuristic, we need a more balanced approach. The `greedy_order_selection_2882` heuristic will allow us to iteratively add the most suitable orders to the schedule based on specific criteria such as closest deadline or shortest processing time. This will help in increasing the number of fulfilled orders while maintaining a balanced schedule.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e. How does nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current state data, the last heuristic applied was `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`, which has shown no further improvement in the last round. The current solution has a fulfillment ratio of 0.8, with 40 orders fulfilled and 10 unfulfilled orders remaining.

### Analysis:
- **Current Fulfillment Ratio**: 0.8
- **Unfulfilled Orders**: 10
- **Feasible Orders to Fulfill**: 7
- **Average Time Cost**: 18.8
- **Max Time Cost**: 23.0

### Considerations:
- The `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e` heuristic has stagnated, indicating that it might have reached its local optimum.
- There are still 10 unfulfilled orders, with only 7 feasible ones.
- The fulfillment ratio could be improved further by exploring other heuristics that may better handle the remaining orders.

### Next Steps:
Given the current scenario, the `greedy_by_order_density_c702` heuristic might be a good choice to explore next. This heuristic aims to maximize the efficiency by considering the value-to-time cost ratio, which could help us in effectively utilizing the remaining feasible orders.

### Decision:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_c702
running steps: 5
explanation: The `greedy_by_order_density_c702` heuristic will help identify and schedule orders that offer the best value to time cost ratio. This should improve the overall efficiency of the production schedule and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders. Given the current state, this heuristic is suitable for the next 5 steps to help us achieve a higher fulfillment ratio.
