                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.\n\npriority_based: These heuristics prioritize orders based on certain criteria such as order density, deadline proximity, and production feasibility, aiming to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.\n\norder_shifting: These heuristics involve shifting orders between production lines or within a line to optimize the schedule, taking into account production capabilities and deadlines.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\ndef shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times.

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

Ensure no production line is left idle if feasible orders are available.\n\n#### Phase 2: Construction\n- **Objective**: Build upon the initial solution by incorporating more orders without violating constraints.\n- **Potential Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Order Shifting**: Apply `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to redistribute orders across lines for better utilization.\n  - **Priority-Based**: Re-evaluate priorities as new orders are added.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Identify unfulfilled orders and assess their feasibility on different production lines.\n  2. Use shifting heuristics to accommodate new orders, focusing on underutilized lines.\n  3. Periodically check if priority-based adjustments can enhance the schedule.\n\n#### Phase 3: Improvement\n- **Objective**: Optimize the current solution to increase the number of fulfilled orders or reduce time costs.\n- **Potential Heuristic Categories**:\n  - **Local Optimization**: Use `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to make local improvements.\n  - **Combined Approach**: Implement `shortest_operation_ae31` for a comprehensive strategy that includes local optimization and order prioritization.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Identify segments of the schedule that can be improved through local changes.\n  2. Apply local optimization heuristics to these segments.\n  3. Assess the impact on overall schedule efficiency and adjust as needed.\n\n#### Phase 4: Evaluation and Adjustment\n- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the current solution and make necessary adjustments.\n- **Execution Steps**:\n  1. Measure the number of fulfilled orders and time efficiency.\n  2. Identify any bottlenecks or underutilized resources.\n  3. Decide if a switch between heuristic categories is needed based on performance metrics.\n  4. Repeat phases as necessary, using different heuristics to explore alternative solutions.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to switch between heuristic categories based on the current state of the solution and the specific challenges encountered.\n- **Evaluation**: After each heuristic application, evaluate its impact and decide the next steps.\n- **Adaptation**: Use feedback from each phase to refine heuristic selection and execution strategies.\n\nThis strategic guide serves as a framework for navigating through the problem-solving process, allowing you to adaptively choose and apply heuristics to improve the solution iteratively."

The priority-based heuristic category is suitable for quickly assessing and scheduling orders based on criteria like deadline proximity and production feasibility.

Given that the fulfillment ratio is still very low (0.02) and there are many unfulfilled orders, continuing with the priority-based approach could help in quickly increasing the number of fulfilled orders by targeting those with the highest potential to meet deadlines and production feasibility. This will help establish a stronger foundation before moving to more complex optimization techniques.\n***"
