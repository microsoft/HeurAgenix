I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding an optimal sequence of production actions across multiple machines, considering constraints like deadlines, production speeds, and transition times, which are characteristic of combinatorial problems. Heuristics are often suitable for such problems due to their ability to find good solutions within reasonable timeframes, especially when the problem space is large and complex. The framework you've described, with its operators and solution structure, is aligned with heuristic approaches commonly used in combinatorial optimization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): local_optimization,priority_based,order_shifting,combined_approach

local_optimization: These heuristics focus on improving the schedule by making small, localized changes such as swapping or reversing segments of orders within production lines, akin to techniques like 2-opt in TSP.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

priority_based: These heuristics prioritize orders based on certain criteria such as order density, deadline proximity, and production feasibility, aiming to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

order_shifting: These heuristics involve shifting orders between production lines or within a line to optimize the schedule, taking into account production capabilities and deadlines.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

combined_approach: These heuristics use a combination of strategies such as prioritization, shifting, and periodic optimization to iteratively improve the schedule.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase involves understanding the problem characteristics and deciding on a flexible approach to adapt to varying scenarios. Here's a structured guide you can follow:

### Strategic Guide for Selecting Heuristic Categories

#### Phase 1: Initialization
- **Objective**: Quickly generate a feasible initial solution.
- **Potential Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Priority-Based**: Use heuristics like `greedy_by_order_density_de77` to prioritize orders and establish an initial schedule. This can help in quickly filling up the schedule with feasible orders.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Evaluate the density and deadline of orders.
  2. Prioritize and schedule high-priority orders on available production lines.
  3. Ensure no production line is left idle if feasible orders are available.

#### Phase 2: Construction
- **Objective**: Build upon the initial solution by incorporating more orders without violating constraints.
- **Potential Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Order Shifting**: Apply `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to redistribute orders across lines for better utilization.
  - **Priority-Based**: Re-evaluate priorities as new orders are added.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Identify unfulfilled orders and assess their feasibility on different production lines.
  2. Use shifting heuristics to accommodate new orders, focusing on underutilized lines.
  3. Periodically check if priority-based adjustments can enhance the schedule.

#### Phase 3: Improvement
- **Objective**: Optimize the current solution to increase the number of fulfilled orders or reduce time costs.
- **Potential Heuristic Categories**:
  - **Local Optimization**: Use `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to make local improvements.
  - **Combined Approach**: Implement `shortest_operation_ae31` for a comprehensive strategy that includes local optimization and order prioritization.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Identify segments of the schedule that can be improved through local changes.
  2. Apply local optimization heuristics to these segments.
  3. Assess the impact on overall schedule efficiency and adjust as needed.

#### Phase 4: Evaluation and Adjustment
- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the current solution and make necessary adjustments.
- **Execution Steps**:
  1. Measure the number of fulfilled orders and time efficiency.
  2. Identify any bottlenecks or underutilized resources.
  3. Decide if a switch between heuristic categories is needed based on performance metrics.
  4. Repeat phases as necessary, using different heuristics to explore alternative solutions.

### Iterative Approach
- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to switch between heuristic categories based on the current state of the solution and the specific challenges encountered.
- **Evaluation**: After each heuristic application, evaluate its impact and decide the next steps.
- **Adaptation**: Use feedback from each phase to refine heuristic selection and execution strategies.

This strategic guide serves as a framework for navigating through the problem-solving process, allowing you to adaptively choose and apply heuristics to improve the solution iteratively.

Explain: Given that all orders are currently unfulfilled and the solution is at its initial stage with no orders scheduled, it is essential to establish a foundation by prioritizing orders for scheduling. The priority-based heuristic category is suitable for quickly assessing and scheduling orders based on criteria like deadline proximity and production feasibility. This approach will help initiate the construction of a feasible solution by focusing on fulfilling the most critical orders first, laying the groundwork for further optimization with other heuristic categories.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->1.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1225->1223
Fulfilled Order Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: least_order_remaining_27ca
Heuristic Category: priority_based
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The initial application of the priority-based heuristic category has successfully scheduled one order, indicating that prioritizing orders based on criteria like deadline proximity and production feasibility is effective at this stage. Given that the fulfillment ratio is still very low (0.02) and there are many unfulfilled orders, continuing with the priority-based approach could help in quickly increasing the number of fulfilled orders by targeting those with the highest potential to meet deadlines and production feasibility. This will help establish a stronger foundation before moving to more complex optimization techniques.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1.0->3.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1223->1216
Fulfilled Order Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Heuristic Category: order_shifting
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The priority-based heuristic has laid a basic foundation by fulfilling two orders, but the fulfillment ratio is still quite low at 0.04, and there are many unfulfilled orders with feasible options available. Switching to the order_shifting category could help redistribute the unfulfilled orders more efficiently across the available production lines, potentially increasing utilization and fulfilling more orders. This category will allow for a more dynamic adjustment of the current schedule, taking advantage of underutilized lines and ensuring that orders are placed where they have the highest likelihood of being completed within their deadlines. This approach aims to enhance the existing solution by optimizing the allocation of orders across production lines.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 3.0->4.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1216->1204
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->3
---Round 3---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Heuristic Category: order_shifting
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution has a low fulfillment ratio of 0.06, indicating significant room for improvement. The previous application of the order_shifting heuristic category has shown some progress by fulfilling one additional order. Continuing with the order_shifting category can help further redistribute orders across production lines, potentially enhancing utilization and fulfilling more orders. This approach leverages the underutilized lines and existing feasible orders, making it a promising choice for further development of the current solution.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 4.0->4.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1204->1204
Fulfilled Order Num: 3->3

The last heuristic category is: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(order_shifting). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: local_optimization,priority_based,order_shifting,combined_approach

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:priority_based
explanation: Despite some progress with the order_shifting category, the fulfillment ratio is still quite low at 0.06, indicating significant room for improvement. Given the large number of feasible unfulfilled orders, it may be beneficial to switch back to a priority-based approach to quickly prioritize and fulfill orders with the highest potential. This could help in rapidly increasing the fulfillment ratio by targeting orders that are critical in terms of deadline proximity and production feasibility. Once more orders are fulfilled, we can revisit local optimization or combined approaches to further refine the solution.
