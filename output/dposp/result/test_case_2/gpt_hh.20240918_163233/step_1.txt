I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

Understood, I have taken note of the details regarding the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) and the framework you've established to tackle it. Your problem involves maximizing the number of completed orders on multiple machines with various constraints, such as differing production speeds, allowed transitions, and order deadlines. The operators you've defined (AppendOperator, InsertOperator, SwapOperator, ReverseSegmentOperator, RelocateOperator, MergeOperator) are intended to modify solutions in the pursuit of optimizing the scheduling problem. The heuristic function signature you provided takes several forms of data to produce an operator and updated algorithm data for iterative problem-solving.

For our future conversations, I will remember the context of the problem and the structure of your framework. When you're ready to discuss the challenges you're facing, we can explore potential solutions and ways to enhance your hyper-heuristic approach to the DPOSP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Each heuristic you've implemented is designed to address specific characteristics of the DPOSP and may be more or less effective depending on the scenario at hand. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each algorithm might be most applicable. These scenarios are best quantified based on factors such as order deadlines, processing times, production speeds, and the state of the current solution:

1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2`:
   - Applicable when there is potential to optimize the schedule by swapping orders, especially when the current solution is near-optimal and fine-tuning is needed.
   - Best when there are multiple production lines and the current sequence may be improved without violating deadlines.
   - Quantified by the number of orders and diversity in production times and deadlines.

2. `farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a`:
   - Suitable for scenarios with a wide range of deadlines.
   - Effective when later deadlines provide flexibility in scheduling without impacting the fulfillment of more urgent orders.
   - Quantified by the variance in order deadlines.

3. `greedy_by_order_density_c702`:
   - Effective in scenarios where orders have significantly different ratios of value to processing time.
   - Ideal when the schedule is sparse and there are multiple opportunities to insert high-density orders.
   - Quantified by the distribution of order densities.

4. `greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e`:
   - Best for scenarios where deadlines are approaching and the focus is on fulfilling imminent orders.
   - Useful when the current schedule has near-term gaps that can be filled without disrupting later orders.
   - Quantified by the proximity of unfulfilled order deadlines.

5. `greedy_order_selection_2882`:
   - Good for initial scheduling when there is a need to quickly establish a baseline solution.
   - Best when there's a clear criterion that identifies the most suitable orders to fulfill first.
   - Quantified by the criteria used for order selection, such as shortest processing time or closest deadline.

6. `least_order_remaining_9c3c`:
   - Suitable for late stages of scheduling where minimizing remaining work is key.
   - Effective when the production schedule is nearly complete and selecting orders with the shortest processing times can quickly close out the schedule.
   - Quantified by the cumulative remaining work of unfulfilled orders.

7. `longest_order_next_c9cb`:
   - Appropriate when there are orders with significantly longer processing times that need to be scheduled early to avoid deadline violations.
   - Quantified by the range of processing times of unfulfilled orders.

8. `maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c`:
   - Ideal for scenarios where it's critical to handle large orders that might otherwise be difficult to fit into the schedule.
   - Quantified by the remaining work (quantity divided by production rate) of unfulfilled orders.

9. `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`:
   - Suitable for dense schedules where minimizing transition times can lead to significant efficiency gains.
   - Quantified by the distribution of transition times and the number of orders with upcoming deadlines.

10. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`:
    - Best when there's an imbalance in the workload between production lines or when certain lines are specialized.
    - Quantified by the distribution of remaining capacity across production lines and the flexibility of order assignments.

11. `random_c05a`:
    - Useful as a diversification strategy within a larger metaheuristic framework or when other heuristics have plateaued.
    - Quantified by the number of attempts made and the variety of feasible orders available.

12. `shortest_operation_time_first_e891`:
    - Effective in early stages or when there is a significant discrepancy in operation times.
    - Quantified by the distribution of operation times across unfulfilled orders.

13. `shortest_order_next_25bd`:
    - Best for early scheduling or when there's a priority to clear small orders quickly.
    - Quantified by the range of processing times and the opportunity to fit short orders into tight schedule windows.

14. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`:
    - Applicable when the current production order sequence is suboptimal and there's potential for rearrangement.
    - Best when there are non-trivial transition times between orders.
    - Quantified by the number of non-adjacent order pairs that can be considered for swapping.

By quantifying the scenarios as suggested, you can more effectively match the heuristics to the state of your DPOSP and potentially improve the quality of your solutions.

Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: This heuristic is chosen to quickly establish a baseline solution. It will prioritize the scheduling of orders based on the nearest deadlines, considering transition times and production speeds, to maximize the number of orders fulfilled by their respective deadlines. Given the current empty state of the production lines and the uniform deadlines for the first set of orders, this heuristic is well-suited for an initial build-up of the schedule.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 99.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1225
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 44

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e. How does greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

assistant
Given the current state of the solution and the data provided, it's clear that we've made substantial progress with a fulfillment ratio of 0.88. However, there are still unfulfilled orders and no feasible orders to fulfill, which suggests that our current schedule might be tight or near capacity, with limited flexibility for inserting the remaining orders without violating deadlines.

Considering the state data, where we have a few unfulfilled orders with some variance in their deadlines and quantity, and given that the feasible_orders_to_fulfill list is empty, it might be beneficial to use a heuristic that can optimize the current tight schedule. This could potentially open up opportunities to fit in the remaining orders.

The `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristics could be suitable here, as they might help in rearranging the current schedule to create space for the remaining orders. Since we have a solution_validity set to True and have already run a greedy heuristic to fill the orders, we need a heuristic that can optimize without necessarily appending new orders.

The `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic seems particularly promising, as it is designed to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders, which might create new feasible spaces for the unfulfilled orders.

Here's my recommendation:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
running steps: 50
explanation: Given the current tight schedule and the existence of unfulfilled orders, the 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic will be used to attempt to rearrange the current schedule. The goal is to find an improved sequence that may open up possibilities for inserting the remaining unfulfilled orders while maintaining the validity of the solution. Running for 50 steps provides an ample opportunity for the heuristic to explore different order sequences and identify potential improvements.
***

By running the `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic, we hope to find a sequence that can potentially accommodate the remaining orders without exceeding their deadlines. If successful, we can then reassess the situation to determine if additional steps or a different heuristic is necessary to complete the schedule.
