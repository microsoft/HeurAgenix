I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. It involves finding an optimal or near-optimal solution from a finite set of possible solutions, where the solution space is defined by the various combinations of orders, production lines, and scheduling sequences. This type of problem is often addressed using heuristic methods due to its complexity and the impracticality of exhaustive searches in large solution spaces. The framework you've described, including the Solution and Operator classes, is well-suited for applying heuristic algorithms to explore and optimize the solution space efficiently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To determine the applicability and effectiveness of each heuristic for the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP), let's analyze the scenarios in which each heuristic might perform best. These scenarios can be characterized by the nature of the order set, production lines, and constraints:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when there is potential for rearranging orders to improve overall scheduling efficiency. It is particularly applicable when the current schedule is suboptimal due to poor order sequencing.
   - **Quantification**: Best suited for scenarios with multiple production lines where orders have flexible deadlines and where swapping can significantly reduce total transition and production times.

2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic performs well when there is a need to quickly prioritize orders based on a combination of tight deadlines, production feasibility, and scheduling flexibility.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in high-pressure scenarios where deadlines are approaching rapidly, and a quick re-evaluation of order priorities is necessary to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.

3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for improving the sequence of production orders within a line, especially when the initial sequence is not optimal, but only minor adjustments are needed to improve efficiency.
   - **Quantification**: Best used when the transition and production times vary significantly between orders, and there is room for optimization by reordering. Suitable for lines with a moderate to high number of orders and diverse order types.

4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable in situations where orders vary widely in production time and urgency, and there is a need to continuously optimize by shifting and swapping orders to meet deadlines.
   - **Quantification**: Performs well when order deadlines are tight, and production lines have differing capabilities. It is effective in dynamic environments with frequent changes in order priorities.

5. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when there is an emphasis on clearing orders with the least remaining processing time to make room for new or more urgent orders.
   - **Quantification**: Works well in environments where the focus is on throughput and minimizing idle time, particularly when orders have similar deadlines but vary in size and complexity.

6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios where production lines have different capabilities, and there is a need to redistribute orders to balance workloads and meet deadlines.
   - **Quantification**: Effective in multi-line setups where certain lines are underutilized or overwhelmed, and where shifting orders can lead to better resource utilization and increased fulfillment rates.

By understanding these scenarios, you can apply the most appropriate heuristic based on the specific characteristics and constraints of your production scheduling problem.

Before this discuss, we have already 57 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Since no orders have been fulfilled yet, we are starting with a constructive heuristic to establish an initial schedule that maximizes order fulfillment based on deadlines and production times.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -3109
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 15
Explain: Since the last heuristic was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31), we should now focus on improving the solution. The exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic will help refine the current schedule by swapping non-adjacent orders to potentially reduce total production and transition times, thereby increasing the number of fulfilled orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: The previous heuristic, exchange_production_orders_eda2, did not lead to any improvement in terms of fulfilled orders or feasible orders to fulfill. As we have a low fulfillment ratio and a high number of unfulfilled orders, it's strategic to return to a constructive approach. Applying shortest_operation_ae31 again will help re-evaluate the current schedule and potentially introduce new orders based on deadlines and production times, providing a foundation for subsequent refinements.

---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Applying the _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e heuristic can help refine the order sequence within the production lines by exploring alternative order sequences, potentially leading to a more efficient schedule and increasing the number of fulfilled orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given the current state data, we have observed that the previous improvement heuristic (_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e) did not lead to any enhancement in the number of fulfilled orders. With a fulfillment ratio of only 0.04 and a large number of unfulfilled orders, it is strategic to reapply a constructive heuristic. The shortest_operation_ae31 will help further establish a foundation by introducing new orders based on deadlines and production times, setting the stage for subsequent refinements.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2.000000000000001

---Round 5---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 10
Explain: Given that the last heuristic applied was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31), it is strategic to now focus on improving the current solution. The _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e heuristic is suitable for refining the order sequence within production lines. This may lead to a more efficient schedule by exploring alternative sequences, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders and optimizing transition and production times.

We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

Based on the given data and the outlined decision-making process, the current fulfillment ratio is low, and there is a substantial number of unfulfilled orders. The last applied heuristic was a constructive one (shortest_operation_ae31), which indicates that an improvement heuristic should be applied next to refine the current solution. Therefore, we will proceed with an improvement heuristic.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
running steps: 10
explanation: The _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e heuristic is selected to refine the order sequence within production lines, as it explores alternative order sequences that may lead to a more efficient schedule by optimizing transition and production times. This strategy aims to increase the number of fulfilled orders and improve schedule efficiency.
