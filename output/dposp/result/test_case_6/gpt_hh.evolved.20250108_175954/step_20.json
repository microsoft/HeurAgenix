                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

These scenarios can be characterized by the nature of the order set, production lines, and constraints:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful when there is potential for rearranging orders to improve overall scheduling efficiency. It is particularly applicable when the current schedule is suboptimal due to poor order sequencing.\n   - **Quantification**: Best suited for scenarios with multiple production lines where orders have flexible deadlines and where swapping can significantly reduce total transition and production times.\n\n2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic performs well when there is a need to quickly prioritize orders based on a combination of tight deadlines, production feasibility, and scheduling flexibility.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in high-pressure scenarios where deadlines are approaching rapidly, and a quick re-evaluation of order priorities is necessary to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.\n\n3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal for improving the sequence of production orders within a line, especially when the initial sequence is not optimal, but only minor adjustments are needed to improve efficiency.\n   - **Quantification**: Best used when the transition and production times vary significantly between orders, and there is room for optimization by reordering. Suitable for lines with a moderate to high number of orders and diverse order types.\n\n4. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable in situations where orders vary widely in production time and urgency, and there is a need to continuously optimize by shifting and swapping orders to meet deadlines.\n   - **Quantification**: Performs well when order deadlines are tight, and production lines have differing capabilities. It is effective in dynamic environments with frequent changes in order priorities.\n\n5. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when there is an emphasis on clearing orders with the least remaining processing time to make room for new or more urgent orders.\n   - **Quantification**: Works well in environments where the focus is on throughput and minimizing idle time, particularly when orders have similar deadlines but vary in size and complexity.\n\n6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable for scenarios where production lines have different capabilities, and there is a need to redistribute orders to balance workloads and meet deadlines.\n   - **Quantification**: Effective in multi-line setups where certain lines are underutilized or overwhelmed, and where shifting orders can lead to better resource utilization and increased fulfillment rates.\n\nBy understanding these scenarios, you can apply the most appropriate heuristic based on the specific characteristics and constraints of your production scheduling problem."

How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
