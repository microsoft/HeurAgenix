I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

Analyzing the scenarios for each heuristic and identifying the best contexts for their application requires understanding the characteristics of the DPOSP problem and the unique mechanisms of each heuristic. Below is the analysis for each heuristic and the quantifiable scenarios where they are most applicable:

---

### **1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Based on the 2-opt approach, this heuristic swaps two non-adjacent orders (within the same or different production lines) to evaluate whether the swap improves the schedule.
- Primarily aims to optimize sequences for better utilization of production and transition times while meeting deadlines.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **High Transition Time Variability:** When transition times between products vary significantly, swapping orders can reduce overall transition costs.
- **Feasibility of Non-Adjacent Swaps:** When swapping two non-adjacent orders can lead to better deadline adherence or time utilization.
- **Tight Deadlines:** When small sequence optimizations can make the difference between meeting or missing deadlines.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Variance in transition times (`std_dev(t_i,p,p')`).
- Percentage of orders currently unfulfilled due to transition time bottlenecks.
- Number of feasible swaps detected in the current solution.

---

### **2. `greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Prioritizes orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and flexibility for future scheduling.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **High Competition for Resources:** When multiple orders compete for limited machine time, prioritizing based on a density metric can help.
- **Many Tight Deadlines:** When several orders have tight deadlines, this heuristic quickly ranks and schedules orders to maximize fulfillment.
- **Low Machine Versatility:** When production lines are specialized and can produce only a few product types, prioritizing based on feasibility becomes critical.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Deadline tightness metric (`D_k - Q_k/v_ip` for each order).
- Machine versatility index (percentage of products that can be produced by each production line).
- Average number of competing orders per production line.

---

### **3. `least_order_remaining_27ca()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Scores orders based on deadline proximity, feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders, aiming to prioritize orders that are at the highest risk of being unfulfilled.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **Many Unfulfilled Orders:** When the current solution leaves many orders unfulfilled, this heuristic prioritizes the riskiest ones.
- **High Deadline Variance:** When some orders have very tight deadlines while others have loose deadlines, this heuristic ensures tighter deadlines are prioritized.
- **High Order Density:** When there are many orders relative to the number of production lines, prioritizing high-risk orders is crucial.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Number of unfulfilled orders in the current solution.
- Variance in order deadlines (`std_dev(D_k)`).
- Ratio of orders to production lines (`order_num / production_line_num`).

---

### **4. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and deadlines.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **Low Line Utilization Imbalance:** When some production lines are underutilized while others are overloaded, this heuristic redistributes orders.
- **Unfulfilled Orders Due to Line Assignment:** When unfulfilled orders are caused by being assigned to inappropriate production lines.
- **High Machine Versatility:** When most production lines can produce the same products, shifting orders becomes feasible.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Line utilization imbalance (difference in total time cost between the most and least utilized lines).
- Percentage of unfulfilled orders due to infeasible line assignment.
- Machine versatility index (percentage of products that can be produced by each line).

---

### **5. `shortest_operation_ae31()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Prioritizes orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times, dynamically searching for better insertion positions and optimizing through shifts and swaps.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **Tight Deadlines Across the Board:** When most orders have tight deadlines, this heuristic ensures quick production of high-priority orders.
- **Dynamic Order Insertion Needs:** When new orders are introduced frequently, dynamic optimization ensures that the schedule remains feasible.
- **Complex Production Environments:** When there are significant variations in production rates, deadlines, and transition times, this heuristic adapts dynamically.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Percentage of orders with tight deadlines (`D_k < Q_k / min(v_ip)`).
- Frequency of new order introductions.
- Variance in production rates across production lines (`std_dev(v_ip)`).

---

### **6. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**
#### **Mechanism:**
- Adapts the 2-opt approach to swap two non-adjacent orders within a production line and re-evaluate efficiency based on production rates, transition times, and deadlines.

#### **Applicable Scenarios:**
- **Long Production Lines:** When production lines handle many orders, sequence optimization within the line can improve overall efficiency.
- **High Transition Time Impact:** When transition times significantly affect the schedule, optimizing sequences reduces overhead.
- **Deadline-Driven Optimization:** When deadlines are a primary constraint, reordering can help meet them without adding new orders.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- Average number of orders per production line.
- Total transition time as a percentage of total production time.
- Percentage of orders with tight deadlines.

---

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.
