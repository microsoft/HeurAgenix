                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

This approach will prioritize orders based on deadlines and feasibility, potentially converting some unfulfilled orders into fulfilled ones. Once we have a base solution, we can then explore other categories to further improve the schedule.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->0.1\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 114331->114326\nFulfilled Order Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c\nHeuristic Category: shift_and_relocate\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given that the initial priority-based heuristic has resulted in fulfilling only one order, it would be beneficial to explore the potential of redistributing or shifting orders between production lines to enhance the current solution. The shift_and_relocate category is well-suited for balancing the load across production lines and potentially unlocking new feasible solutions by optimizing the arrangement of orders. This approach can help in improving the fulfillment ratio by effectively utilizing the available production capacity and meeting order deadlines.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.1->0.5\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 114326->114326\nFulfilled Order Num: 1->1\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nHeuristic Category: improvement_based\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Given the current state where only one order has been fulfilled and the fulfillment ratio is very low, it would be beneficial to focus on improving the existing solution. The improvement-based category, which includes heuristics like `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`, can help enhance the current production schedule by making local optimizations. These heuristics can explore the possibility of rearranging the current order sequence to maximize the number of fulfilled orders, taking advantage of the specific constraints and opportunities within the DPOSP framework. This approach aims to incrementally improve the solution by identifying and implementing small changes that lead to better overall scheduling efficiency.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.5->0.5\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 114326->114326\nFulfilled Order Num: 1->1\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nproduction_line_0: \nproduction_line_1: \nproduction_line_2: \nproduction_line_3: \nproduction_line_4: \nproduction_line_5: \nproduction_line_6: \nproduction_line_7: \nproduction_line_8: \nproduction_line_9: \nproduction_line_10: \nproduction_line_11: \nproduction_line_12: \nproduction_line_13: \nproduction_line_14: \nproduction_line_15: 5\nproduction_line_16: \nproduction_line_17: \nproduction_line_18: \nproduction_line_19: \n\nfulfilled_order_num:1\nfulfilled_orders:[5]\ntotal_time_cost_per_production_line:[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nfulfillment_ratio:0.002\naverage_time_cost:0.025\nmax_time_cost:0.5\nunfulfilled_order_quantity_sum:13465.0\nunfulfilled_order_deadline_variance:1135.9567873221392\nfeasible_order_count:453\nsolution_validity:True\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(improvement_based).
