I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id

        return Solution(new_schedule)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a segment of orders within a production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id
        self.segments = segments
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            if start_index > end_index:
                (start_index, end_index) = (end_index, start_index)
            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)
class RelocateOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Moves an order from one position to another within the same or to a different production line."""
    def __init__(self, source_production_line_id: int, source_position: int, target_production_line_id: int, target_position: int):

        return Solution(new_schedule)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described is indeed a combinatorial operation problem. This type of problem involves making a sequence of decisions to optimize a specific objective, often under complex constraints, which is characteristic of combinatorial operations. The use of heuristic algorithms and operators to explore the solution space and find optimal or near-optimal solutions aligns well with solving combinatorial problems.

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): improvement_based,priority_based,shift_and_relocate,combined_approach

improvement_based: these heuristics focus on improving the current solution by making local changes such as swapping or reversing segments to enhance the production schedule.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

priority_based: these heuristics prioritize orders based on criteria like deadline tightness, production feasibility, and order density, aiming to maximize order fulfillment.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

shift_and_relocate: these heuristics focus on shifting and relocating orders between production lines to achieve a more balanced and efficient scheduling.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

combined_approach: these heuristics combine multiple strategies, such as prioritization and shifting, to optimize the scheduling process.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase, consider the following framework:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection and Execution

#### Phase 1: Initial Solution Construction
- **Objective:** Quickly generate a feasible solution that serves as a starting point for further optimization.
- **Suggested Categories:**
  - **Priority-Based Heuristics:**
    - Use heuristics like `greedy_by_order_density_de77` or `least_order_remaining_27ca` to prioritize orders based on deadline tightness and feasibility.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      - Rank orders based on a combination of criteria such as deadline proximity, production feasibility, and order density.
      - Assign orders to production lines according to their priority, ensuring that initial deadlines are respected.
      - Validate the solution to ensure feasibility.

#### Phase 2: Solution Improvement
- **Objective:** Refine the initial solution to enhance efficiency and increase the number of fulfilled orders.
- **Suggested Categories:**
  - **Improvement-Based Heuristics:**
    - Utilize `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to perform local optimizations by swapping or reversing orders.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      - Evaluate the impact of potential swaps or reversals on the production schedule.
      - Apply changes that result in a more efficient schedule, respecting deadlines and transition constraints.
      - Iterate over different order pairs or segments to explore multiple potential improvements.

  - **Shift and Relocate Heuristics:**
    - Implement `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` or `shortest_operation_ae31` to balance the load across production lines.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      - Identify underutilized or overburdened production lines.
      - Relocate or shift orders to achieve a more balanced and efficient schedule.
      - Continuously assess the feasibility of the new schedule and adjust as needed.

#### Phase 3: Combined Optimization
- **Objective:** Integrate multiple strategies for comprehensive optimization.
- **Suggested Categories:**
  - **Combined Approach Heuristics:**
    - Use heuristics like `least_order_remaining_27ca` and `shortest_operation_ae31` to incorporate multiple strategies.
    - **Execution Steps:**
      - Prioritize orders while simultaneously exploring relocation and shifting opportunities.
      - Perform regular checks and balances between prioritization and load balancing.
      - Continuously refine the schedule by alternating between improvement and shift/relocate strategies.

### Iterative and Adaptive Strategy
- **Experimentation:** Regularly test different heuristic combinations and assess their effectiveness.
- **Evaluation:** After each iteration, evaluate the performance of the applied heuristics based on the number of fulfilled orders and overall schedule efficiency.
- **Adaptation:** Be prepared to switch heuristics or heuristic categories if performance plateaus or declines. Use evaluation metrics to guide these decisions.

### Considerations
- Ensure that all heuristic applications maintain the feasibility of the schedule, respecting production line capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
- Balance between exploration (trying new heuristics) and exploitation (refining the current solution) to maximize the potential for improvement.
- Keep track of the performance data for each heuristic application to inform future decisions and adaptations.

By following this strategic guide, you can systematically apply and evaluate different heuristic categories, adapting your approach based on performance outcomes to achieve optimal scheduling solutions for the DPOSP.
