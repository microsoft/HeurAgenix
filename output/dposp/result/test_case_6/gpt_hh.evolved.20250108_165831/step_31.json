                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines.

Here\u2019s an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where there is significant variability in production times and transition costs between orders, and the current schedule has inefficiencies due to suboptimal ordering.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Instances where swapping orders within or between production lines can lead to significant reductions in total production time or transition time, especially when current order sequences are close to feasible but not optimal.\n\n2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there is a need to quickly identify and fulfill orders that are closer to their deadlines and have higher feasibility scores, ensuring that the most critical orders are prioritized.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Cases with tight deadlines across many orders, where prioritizing based on a combination of deadline proximity and production feasibility leads to higher fulfillment rates.\n\n3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e**:\n   - **Scenario**: Effective in scenarios where order sequences within production lines have room for optimization, particularly when there are clear inefficiencies in the current sequence that can be improved through local search methods.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Situations where non-adjacent swaps can substantially improve total production efficiency, especially when the initial order sequence was generated quickly or randomly.\n\n4. **shortest_operation_ae31**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic shines in complex, dynamic environments where continuously optimizing and adjusting order positions can lead to maximized order fulfillment. It is particularly useful when the production landscape changes frequently or when orders have varying levels of priority and feasibility.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Scenarios with a high number of orders and production lines where frequent adjustments and optimizations are necessary, especially when initial plans frequently become infeasible due to shifting priorities or constraints.\n\n5. **least_order_remaining_27ca**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in contexts where there is a need to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on those that can be completed with the least remaining effort or time.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Instances where many orders are close to completion and small adjustments can lead to a significant increase in fulfilled orders, particularly when deadlines are not the primary constraint.\n\n6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where production lines have varying capabilities and there is a need to balance load or reallocate orders to lines that can fulfill them more efficiently.\n   - **Best Quantified by**: Situations where shifting orders between lines can resolve bottlenecks or where certain lines have underutilized capacity that can be better leveraged by taking on additional orders.\n\nIn each case, the specific characteristics of the production environment, such as the variability in production speeds, transition times, deadlines, and order complexity, will dictate which heuristic is most effective. By quantifying these scenarios, you can better determine the most appropriate heuristic to apply in a given situation to optimize the scheduling process."

This will establish a strong initial solution framework by maximizing the number of fulfilled orders at this stage.

Given the high number of unfulfilled orders and the low fulfillment ratio, an improvement heuristic like _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e is a suitable next step. This heuristic will help optimize the sequence of orders on each production line, potentially reducing total production and transition times and increasing the number of fulfilled orders.

Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important.
