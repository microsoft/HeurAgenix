I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you described fits within the realm of combinatorial optimization problems. It involves finding an optimal arrangement or sequence of operations (production orders) across multiple machines to maximize the number of completed orders without violating constraints like deadlines and transition restrictions. The use of heuristics is appropriate for such problems, as they can efficiently explore the search space to find good, if not optimal, solutions within reasonable timeframes. The framework you've outlined, including the use of a Solution class and various operators, provides a structured approach to apply different heuristic algorithms to tackle this problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable involves understanding the strengths of each approach, the specific challenges or constraints of the DPOSP, and how each heuristic addresses these elements. Hereâs an analysis of potential scenarios for each heuristic:

1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suited for situations where there is significant variability in production times and transition costs between orders, and the current schedule has inefficiencies due to suboptimal ordering.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Instances where swapping orders within or between production lines can lead to significant reductions in total production time or transition time, especially when current order sequences are close to feasible but not optimal.

2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is ideal when there is a need to quickly identify and fulfill orders that are closer to their deadlines and have higher feasibility scores, ensuring that the most critical orders are prioritized.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Cases with tight deadlines across many orders, where prioritizing based on a combination of deadline proximity and production feasibility leads to higher fulfillment rates.

3. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e**:
   - **Scenario**: Effective in scenarios where order sequences within production lines have room for optimization, particularly when there are clear inefficiencies in the current sequence that can be improved through local search methods.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Situations where non-adjacent swaps can substantially improve total production efficiency, especially when the initial order sequence was generated quickly or randomly.

4. **shortest_operation_ae31**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic shines in complex, dynamic environments where continuously optimizing and adjusting order positions can lead to maximized order fulfillment. It is particularly useful when the production landscape changes frequently or when orders have varying levels of priority and feasibility.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Scenarios with a high number of orders and production lines where frequent adjustments and optimizations are necessary, especially when initial plans frequently become infeasible due to shifting priorities or constraints.

5. **least_order_remaining_27ca**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is applicable in contexts where there is a need to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on those that can be completed with the least remaining effort or time.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Instances where many orders are close to completion and small adjustments can lead to a significant increase in fulfilled orders, particularly when deadlines are not the primary constraint.

6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c**:
   - **Scenario**: Ideal for scenarios where production lines have varying capabilities and there is a need to balance load or reallocate orders to lines that can fulfill them more efficiently.
   - **Best Quantified by**: Situations where shifting orders between lines can resolve bottlenecks or where certain lines have underutilized capacity that can be better leveraged by taking on additional orders.

In each case, the specific characteristics of the production environment, such as the variability in production speeds, transition times, deadlines, and order complexity, will dictate which heuristic is most effective. By quantifying these scenarios, you can better determine the most appropriate heuristic to apply in a given situation to optimize the scheduling process.

Before this discuss, we have already 10 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Starting with the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help prioritize orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. This will establish a strong initial solution framework by maximizing the number of fulfilled orders at this stage. Once we have a baseline solution, we can proceed with improvement heuristics.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 9.3
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -13068
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 49
---Round 1---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: The current state shows that we have already applied the shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic, which is a constructive approach. Given the high number of unfulfilled orders and the low fulfillment ratio, an improvement heuristic like _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e is a suitable next step. This heuristic will help optimize the sequence of orders on each production line, potentially reducing total production and transition times and increasing the number of fulfilled orders. By focusing on local improvements, we aim to enhance the overall efficiency of the current solution. This step aligns with the strategy of alternating between constructive and improvement heuristics to incrementally develop a more optimal solution.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Given that the last heuristic used was an improvement heuristic (_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e) and did not lead to an increase in fulfilled orders or a decrease in time cost, it is beneficial to switch back to a constructive heuristic. The shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will help prioritize and restructure the order list based on deadlines and feasibility, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio and setting a stronger foundation for further optimization.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 26.100000000000005
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -12430
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 40
---Round 3---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Since the last heuristic applied was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31), it's appropriate to switch to an improvement heuristic like _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. This heuristic will help optimize the sequence of orders on each production line, potentially reducing total production and transition times, and increasing the number of fulfilled orders. Given the current state data, focusing on local improvements is a strategic step to enhance the overall efficiency of the current solution.

Explain: The shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will prioritize and restructure the order list based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. This approach will aim to increase the fulfillment ratio and provide a more robust foundation for further optimization. Since the previous improvement heuristic didn't yield changes, focusing on constructing a better base solution is crucial.

Running Steps: 50
Explain: Given that the last heuristic applied was a constructive heuristic (shortest_operation_ae31), it is now appropriate to switch to an improvement heuristic like _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. This heuristic will help optimize the sequence of orders on each production line, potentially reducing total production and transition times and increasing the number of fulfilled orders. Since previous attempts with _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e did not yield immediate improvements, we will run it again to explore further potential for sequence optimization, as the constructive heuristic has provided a better foundation to work from.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) some steps and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic (such as shortest_operation_ae31) for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
running steps: 50
explanation: Given that the last heuristic applied was an improvement heuristic (_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e), and there were no changes in the number of fulfilled orders or time cost, it is beneficial to switch back to a constructive heuristic. The shortest_operation_ae31 heuristic will prioritize and restructure the order list based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio and setting a stronger foundation for further optimization.
