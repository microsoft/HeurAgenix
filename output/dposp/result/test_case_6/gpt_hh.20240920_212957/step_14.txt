I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

        return Solution(new_schedule)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Sure, let's analyze the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable and how these scenarios can be quantified.

### 1. **Exchange Production Orders (EDA2)**
- **Scenario:** Useful when the current schedule has some inefficiencies due to non-optimal ordering of jobs, especially when there are many orders with varied deadlines and production times.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:** 
  - High variance in order deadlines.
  - High variance in transition times between orders.

### 2. **Farthest Deadline Insertion (7E8A)**
- **Scenario:** Effective when there are orders with far-reaching deadlines that might be overlooked by more myopic heuristics.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - Presence of orders with very distant deadlines compared to the average deadline.

### 3. **Greedy by Order Density (C702)**
- **Scenario:** Best when you want to prioritize orders that can be completed quickly relative to their complexity.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High ratio of order quantity to production speed.
  - Low transition times between orders.

### 4. **Greedy Deadline Proximity (AC6E)**
- **Scenario:** Optimal when the goal is to minimize the risk of missing deadlines by focusing on orders that are due soon.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - Low variance in order deadlines, with many orders having close deadlines.

### 5. **Greedy Order Selection (2882)**
- **Scenario:** General-purpose heuristic that works well under a variety of conditions but may not be optimal for specialized scenarios.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - Balanced distribution of production times and deadlines.

### 6. **Least Order Remaining (9C3C)**
- **Scenario:** Effective when there are many small orders that can be quickly completed, allowing for rapid fulfillment.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High number of small orders with short processing times.

### 7. **Longest Order Next (C9CB)**
- **Scenario:** Applicable when there are a few large orders that dominate the schedule and need to be prioritized.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - Presence of orders with significantly longer processing times than others.

### 8. **Maximum Remaining Work Order (EC9C)**
- **Scenario:** Useful when it's critical to complete the largest, most time-consuming orders to make room for smaller tasks.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High variance in order sizes with a few very large orders.

### 9. **Nearest Order Scheduling (1A5E)**
- **Scenario:** Effective when minimizing transition times is crucial, especially when the transition times are large relative to production times.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High transition times compared to production times.

### 10. **Order Shift Between Lines (BD0C)**
- **Scenario:** Useful when there is an imbalance in workload between production lines, and shifting orders can balance the load.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High variance in total time cost per production line.

### 11. **Random (C05A)**
- **Scenario:** Useful for generating diverse initial solutions that can be refined by other heuristics.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - Useful in early stages of optimization or when other heuristics are stuck in local optima.

### 12. **Shortest Operation Time First (E891)**
- **Scenario:** Effective when you want to quickly complete the smallest tasks to free up resources.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High number of orders with short processing times.

### 13. **Shortest Order Next (25BD)**
- **Scenario:** Similar to Shortest Operation Time First, but focuses on the next shortest order to maintain a balanced schedule.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High variance in order processing times, with many small orders.

### 14. **2-opt Production Sequence (8E5E)**
- **Scenario:** Useful for fine-tuning an already good solution by exploring small local changes in the order sequence.
- **Quantifiable Metrics:**
  - High variance in transition times, indicating potential for optimization by reordering.

### Summary of Quantifiable Metrics:
1. **Variance in Order Deadlines:** Indicates the spread of deadlines which can inform the use of deadline-focused heuristics.
2. **Variance in Transition Times:** High variance suggests potential gains from optimizing order sequences.
3. **Order Quantity to Production Speed Ratio:** High ratios indicate potential gains from density-focused heuristics.
4. **Presence of Large Orders:** Indicates scenarios where focusing on the longest or most demanding orders might be beneficial.
5. **Balance of Workload:** High variance in workload across lines suggests the need for balancing heuristics.

By understanding these scenarios and their quantifiable metrics, you can select the most appropriate heuristic for a given situation in the DPOSP problem.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e. How does _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

assistant
Based on the provided data and the summary of previous rounds, we can make an informed decision on the next heuristic to apply.

### Analysis of the Current State:
- **Global Data:**
  - High variance in deadlines (`deadline_variance`: 1140.0622560000002).
  - High number of orders (`order_num`: 500) and production lines (`production_line_num`: 20).
  - High variance in production rates across products.

- **State Data:**
  - Significant number of unfulfilled orders (147 out of 500).
  - Feasible orders to fulfill: 2.
  - Fulfillment ratio: 0.706.
  - High variance in total time cost per production line (`max_time_cost`: 119.0).

### Recent Heuristic Performance:
- **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e:** 
  - Showed a reduction in total time cost and an increase in the number of feasible orders to fulfill.
  - However, in the last round, it did not further improve the solution (`Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0`).

### Decision:
Given the current state and the recent performance of the _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e heuristic, it seems that this heuristic might have reached its limit in improving the solution further. Additionally, the significant variance in deadlines and production times suggests that a heuristic focusing on deadline proximity or balancing workloads might be more effective.

### Recommended Heuristic:
Considering the high variance in deadlines and the need to balance workloads, the **Order Shift Between Lines (BD0C)** heuristic has previously shown significant improvements in balancing the workload and reducing total time cost. Given this, it is worth reapplying to further optimize the current solution.

### Next Steps:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
running steps: 50
explanation: The Order Shift Between Lines heuristic has shown significant improvements in balancing the workload and reducing total time cost in the previous rounds. Given the current high variance in total time cost per production line and the need to fulfill more orders, continuing with this heuristic should help further balance the workload and improve overall schedule efficiency.
