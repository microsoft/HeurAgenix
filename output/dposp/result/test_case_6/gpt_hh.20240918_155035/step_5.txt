I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

Understood. You are working on the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP), which aims to maximize the number of completed orders given the constraints of production speed, transition times, and order deadlines across multiple machines. Your optimization model includes decision variables (X_ij), input variables (v_ip, t_i,p,p', Q_k, P_k, D_k), and intermediate variables (s_ij, e_ij), along with an objective function and several constraints.

Additionally, you have created a solution representation and multiple operator classes (`AppendOperator`, `InsertOperator`, `SwapOperator`, `ReverseSegmentOperator`, `RelocateOperator`, `MergeOperator`) within a framework to support different heuristic algorithms. These operators are designed to modify the scheduling solution.

You've also described a standardized heuristic function signature which takes various types of data (`global_data`, `state_data`, `algorithm_data`, `get_state_data_function`, and other hyper-parameters) and outputs a tuple containing an operator instance and an updated algorithm dictionary.

I have committed to memory the problem description and the framework you've constructed for the DPOSP. When you're ready to discuss the challenges you're encountering, feel free to continue the conversation, and we can work together to resolve them.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To properly analyze the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable and best quantify these scenarios, we need to consider various factors such as the production environment, the characteristics of the orders, and the constraints of the DPOSP. Here's a general analysis for each heuristic mentioned, keeping in mind that the actual performance might depend heavily on specific problem instances and parameter settings:

1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2`: Applicable in scenarios where there's diversity in the order deadlines and production times, and where local optimizations (such as swapping orders) can lead to global improvements. Best when a schedule is nearly optimized but has room for slight adjustments.

2. `farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a`: Suitable for scenarios where orders have a wide range of deadlines. Particularly useful when the system needs to prioritize orders that are not urgent yet to avoid future bottlenecks.

3. `greedy_by_order_density_c702`: Effective when there's a significant variance in the order value-to-time ratio across orders. This heuristic is likely to work well when the goal is to maximize throughput in terms of order value.

4. `greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e`: Best for scenarios with tight deadlines and when the schedule is being built from scratch. It ensures that urgent orders are processed first, minimizing the risk of missing deadlines.

5. `greedy_order_selection_2882`: Useful in various settings due to its generic approach. The specific criterion for selection can be tailored to the most pressing need, be it deadline, processing time, or any other factor.

6. `least_order_remaining_9c3c`: Ideal for scenarios where minimizing work-in-progress is a priority. It's best used when the system aims to quickly finish small orders to keep the production lines flexible.

7. `longest_order_next_c9cb`: Applicable when the system can benefit from scheduling complex orders early, such as when there are few large orders that could block the system if left for later.

8. `maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c`: Suitable for scenarios where the focus is on maximizing resource utilization and ensuring the most labor-intensive orders are completed, especially in the mid to late stages of the scheduling process.

9. `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`: Effective in environments where transition times are significant and can be minimized by intelligent order sequencing. Also useful when starting with a specific order due to external constraints.

10. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`: Best for scenarios where flexibility between production lines can be leveraged to avoid bottlenecks and ensure orders are completed on time.

11. `random_c05a`: Can be used in exploratory phases or when other heuristics have plateaued, to introduce randomness and potentially escape local optima. The max_attempts parameter can be tuned to balance between randomness and computational effort.

12. `shortest_operation_time_first_e891`: Suitable for scenarios prioritizing quick wins and fast turnover, where completing orders quickly is more important than strategic order sequencing.

13. `shortest_order_next_25bd`: Similar to the shortest operation time first heuristic but focused on the individual order level. Most effective when there's a mix of short and long orders.

14. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`: Best for mature schedules that require fine-tuning. This heuristic is particularly suitable for schedules that are suboptimal due to the sequence of orders rather than the selection of orders.

Quantification of the scenarios can involve:

- Variance in order deadlines (high variance may favor deadline-based heuristics).
- Ratio of transition time to production time (high ratios may favor sequencing heuristics).
- Distribution of order sizes (a mix of small and large orders may favor heuristics that focus on operation time).
- Current schedule completeness (early vs. late-stage scheduling may require different heuristics).
- Urgency distribution (more urgent orders may require deadline proximity heuristics).

The actual performance of these heuristics would depend on the specific parameters of the DPOSP instance and would typically require empirical testing to identify the most suitable heuristic for a given scenario. It's also common to combine these heuristics in a hyper-heuristic framework to adapt to the problem dynamically.

Before this discuss, we have already 5 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: This heuristic is chosen for its focus on deadline proximity, which is critical at the initial stage of scheduling to prevent missing early deadlines and to effectively utilize the current flexibility of the empty production lines. A hundred steps will allow us to establish a substantial initial schedule and assess its effectiveness before deciding whether to continue with the same heuristic or switch to another one that can further refine the solution.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 486.5666666666666
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -11678
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 100
---Round 1---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 50
Explain: Given that the greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e heuristic has been run to establish an initial schedule by considering deadline proximity, we should now look to optimize the current schedule further. The exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic is chosen for its 2-opt approach, which can effectively improve the current solution by locally optimizing the sequence of orders. This may lead to a more efficient overall schedule that respects deadlines and production constraints. A smaller number of steps (50) is chosen to allow for a focused and computationally less intensive optimization phase, after which the solution's progress can be reassessed.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: -14.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 448
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 2---
Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 75
Explain: This heuristic focuses on adding orders to the schedule based on their deadline proximity, ensuring that urgent orders are prioritized and that the schedule remains feasible. Running it for 75 steps allows us to add a substantial number of orders while still being able to assess and react to the schedule's development.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 485.20000000000005
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -18638
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 75
---Round 3---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Given the current state of the system, where we have a substantial number of fulfilled orders (175 out of 500), it seems that the greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e heuristic has been effective in constructing an initial solution. However, as we progress, the opportunity for improving the schedule through local optimization increases. The exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic, which is based on the 2-opt approach and is adept at fine-tuning, can potentially enhance the current solution by swapping non-adjacent orders. This could lead to a reduction in total time cost and an increase in the number of feasible orders to fulfill, especially since the last execution of this heuristic did not improve the fulfilled order count but managed to increase the feasible order count. Running this for 100 steps will allow us to capitalize on the current diversity of deadlines and order sizes, aiming for a more globally optimized schedule that could accommodate more orders within the existing deadlines.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: -1.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 100
Explain: Returning to the greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e heuristic should allow us to focus on filling production line slots with orders that are nearing their deadlines, thereby increasing the number of fulfilled orders. We choose to run 100 steps as this number of iterations previously resulted in a substantial increase in fulfilled orders without overcommitting to the heuristic in case adjustments are needed based on the results of this round.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 658.2333333333333
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -39841

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e. How does greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

assistant
Given the current state of the solution and the performance of the previously applied heuristics, it seems that the greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e has been effective in increasing the fulfilled order count significantly in each round it was applied. However, the exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic, while it did not improve the fulfilled order count, increased the number of feasible orders to fulfill, indicating it has the potential to optimize the schedule further.

Considering that we have already used the greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e heuristic for several rounds and have a significant number of fulfilled orders, it might be beneficial to now focus on optimizing the current schedule to fit in as many of the remaining feasible orders as possible without violating deadlines.

The exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic appears to be a good candidate for this stage, aiming to optimize the sequence of orders and potentially allowing more orders to be inserted into the schedule. Since the last execution of this heuristic did not add any fulfilled orders but did not negatively impact the feasible order count, it suggests there's room for improvement in the schedule's order sequence without compromising the current solution's validity.

We should consider the fact that we have a high deadline variance and a considerable number of feasible orders remaining. The feasibility of the orders and the current high fulfillment ratio suggest that a heuristic focusing on order insertion and schedule optimization might be more beneficial than one solely focused on fulfilling immediate deadlines.

Therefore, the proposal is to apply the exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic again, with a reasonable number of steps to observe its impact on the order sequence and the feasibility of including more orders.

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
running steps: 75
explanation: Given the current high fulfillment ratio and remaining feasible orders, further optimization of the schedule's sequence could potentially allow for the inclusion of additional feasible orders. The exchange_production_orders_eda2 heuristic provides a method of local optimization that could lead to a more globally efficient schedule. A step count of 75 is chosen to balance between making significant changes and the ability to review and adjust the strategy if needed.
