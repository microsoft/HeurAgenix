                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\ndef shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times.

By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines.

                "text": "Here is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable, along with suggestions for quantifiable metrics to identify these scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic is suitable when the current production schedule has orders that are not optimally placed, leading to inefficient transition times or underutilized production lines.  \n   - It is particularly effective when there are many orders with overlapping deadlines and high transition time variability.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - High total transition time across production lines.  \n   - High variance in production line utilization (some lines have excessive idle time or low workloads).  \n   - A significant number of unfulfilled orders despite feasible scheduling options.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic is best applied when the focus is on quickly identifying high-priority orders that are feasible to fulfill based on a combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and future flexibility.  \n   - It is effective in scenarios where the order deadlines are tight or when there is a large backlog of pending orders.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - Large number of unfulfilled orders with tight deadlines.  \n   - High average order density (calculated as `order_quantity / time_remaining_before_deadline`).  \n   - High ratio of unfulfilled orders to total orders.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **least_order_remaining_27ca**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic works well in situations where the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on those orders with the least remaining time before their deadlines.  \n   - It is applicable when deadlines are the primary constraint, and production feasibility is less variable.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - High number of orders with deadlines approaching (`time_remaining_before_deadline` is very small).  \n   - Low variance in production feasibility across production lines (i.e., most orders are producible on most machines).  \n   - High proportion of orders at risk of being unfulfilled due to deadline constraints.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic is useful when some production lines are overloaded while others are underutilized, and shifting orders between lines can help balance the workload.  \n   - It is applicable when production line capabilities and transition rules allow for flexibility in reassigning orders.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - High variance in production line workloads (`total_time_cost_per_production_line`).  \n   - Significant difference in the number of fulfilled orders across production lines.  \n   - High feasibility of shifting orders (`feasible_orders_to_fulfill` includes many orders that can be reassigned).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **shortest_operation_ae31**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic is ideal when the focus is on scheduling shorter production operations first to maximize the number of fulfilled orders.  \n   - It is effective in scenarios with a large number of small orders and where production times vary significantly across products and machines.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - High number of small orders (`order_quantity` is relatively small for many orders).  \n   - High variance in production times for the same product across different machines (`v_ip` values vary significantly).  \n   - High proportion of orders that are feasible to complete quickly (`time_cost_delta` for many orders is low).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e**\n   **Scenario:**  \n   - This heuristic is applicable when the sequence of orders within a single production line is suboptimal, leading to excessive transition times or inefficient scheduling.  \n   - It is particularly effective when there are many orders assigned to each production line, and the sequence strongly affects the total production time.\n\n   **Quantifiable Metrics:**  \n   - High total transition time within production lines.  \n   - High average sequence inefficiency (calculated as `sum(transition_time + production_time) / number_of_orders`).  \n   - Large number of orders assigned to each production line.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Scenarios and Metrics\n\n| **Heuristic**                  | **Primary Scenario**                                      | **Quantifiable Metrics**                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| exchange_production_orders_eda2 | Inefficient order placement and high transition time      | High transition time, high variance in production line utilization, many unfulfilled orders.              |\n| greedy_by_order_density_de77    | Tight deadlines and large backlog                        | Large unfulfilled orders, high order density, high unfulfilled-to-total order ratio.                      |\n| least_order_remaining_27ca      | Maximize orders with approaching deadlines               | High number of approaching deadlines, low variance in production feasibility, high proportion of risky orders. |\n| order_shift_between_lines_bd0c  | Imbalanced production line workloads                     | High workload variance, significant differences in fulfilled orders across lines, high feasibility of shifting orders. |\n| shortest_operation_ae31         | Many small orders with varying production times          | High number of small orders, high production time variance, low time cost for feasible orders.            |\n| _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e  | Suboptimal order sequence within production lines        | High transition time within lines, high sequence inefficiency, many orders per production line.           |\n\n---\n\nBy quantifying the above metrics, you can dynamically select the most appropriate heuristic for the current state of the problem.

Using the greedy_by_order_density_de77 heuristic will help prioritize orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility, which is critical at this initialization stage to construct a meaningful starting solution.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 41.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -45\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 10\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: greedy_by_order_density_de77. How does greedy_by_order_density_de77 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
