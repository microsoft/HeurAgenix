I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

        new_schedule = [order[:] for order in solution.production_schedule]
        new_schedule[self.production_line_id].append(self.order_id)
        return Solution(new_schedule)

        return Solution(new_schedule)
class ReverseSegmentOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Reverses a segment of orders within a production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, segments: list[tuple[int, int]]):
        self.production_line_id = production_line_id

        for segment in self.segments:
            (start_index, end_index) = segment
            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            assert 0 <= end_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])
            if start_index > end_index:

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

    def __init__(self, source_production_line_id: int, source_position: int, target_production_line_id: int, target_position: int):

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To analyze the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable, it's important to consider the characteristics of the problem, including deadlines, transition times, production rates, and the flexibility of scheduling. Below is a detailed analysis of the scenarios for each heuristic and how they can be best quantified:

---

### 1. **`exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Applicable when the current production schedule has inefficiencies caused by suboptimal order sequences on the same or different production lines.
     - Works best when there are orders with flexible deadlines, allowing for reordering without violating feasibility.
     - Effective when transition times and production times are dominant factors in the schedule's inefficiency.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High transition time variance between products.
     - Moderate to high production line utilization.
     - Orders with overlapping deadlines or close proximity deadlines.

---

### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Applicable when there is a need to quickly prioritize orders based on their "density" (a combination of deadline tightness, feasibility, and flexibility).
     - Works well in a scenario with a large number of orders and limited computational resources, where fast heuristic decisions are needed.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High order-to-production-line ratio.
     - Wide variation in order deadlines and quantities.
     - Low computational budget for scheduling.

---

### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Useful in scenarios where the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on orders that are most likely to be completed within their deadlines.
     - Works well when there are many orders with varying levels of urgency and feasibility.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in order deadlines.
     - Moderate to high number of unfulfilled orders.
     - High competition for production line resources.

---

### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Applicable when some production lines are underutilized or overburdened, and there is potential to balance the load by shifting orders.
     - Effective when there is significant disparity in production line capabilities or when certain production lines are specialized for specific products.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High imbalance in production line utilization (e.g., some lines have high total time costs, while others are idle).
     - Orders that are infeasible on one production line but feasible on another.
     - Low transition time variance between certain products on different lines.

---

### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Best suited for scenarios where the production schedule is dominated by long production times, and there is a need to prioritize shorter operations to maximize throughput.
     - Effective when there are many orders with short production times that can be scheduled around longer operations.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in production times across orders.
     - High variance in production rates across production lines.
     - Moderate to high number of unfulfilled orders.

---

### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**
   - **Scenario**: 
     - Applicable when the order sequence within a production line is suboptimal and causes inefficiencies due to high transition times or poor alignment with deadlines.
     - Works well when there is room to optimize within a single production line without violating feasibility.
   - **Quantification**:
     - High variance in transition times between consecutive orders on the same production line.
     - Low to moderate number of orders per production line.
     - High proportion of unfulfilled orders due to sequence inefficiencies.

---

### Synthesis and Quantitative Metrics:
To determine the best-suited heuristic for a given scenario, the following quantifiable metrics can be used:
1. **Transition Time Variance**: High variance suggests inefficiencies that can be addressed by `exchange_production_orders_eda2()` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`.
2. **Deadline Tightness**: Orders with tight deadlines may benefit from `greedy_by_order_density_de77()` or `least_order_remaining_27ca()`.
3. **Production Line Utilization**: Imbalanced utilization indicates the potential for improvement using `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`.
4. **Production Time Variance**: High variance in production times favors `shortest_operation_ae31()`.
5. **Order-to-Production-Line Ratio**: A high ratio may necessitate fast decision-making via `greedy_by_order_density_de77()`.

By combining these metrics, it is possible to select the most appropriate heuristic or even design a hybrid approach that dynamically switches between them based on the current state of the problem.
