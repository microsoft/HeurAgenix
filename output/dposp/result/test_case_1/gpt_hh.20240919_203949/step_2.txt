I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.
def least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:
    """Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.
    
    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it
    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it
    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.

    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.
def shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

assistant
Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic algorithm is applicable involves understanding the key characteristics and strengths of each heuristic. Here's an analysis of when each heuristic might be most effective, and how these scenarios can be quantified:

1. **Exchange Production Orders (EDA2)**
   - **Scenario:** Useful when small changes in the order sequence can lead to significant improvements. Particularly effective when the current solution is close to optimal but needs fine-tuning.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High initial fulfillment rate but with some orders slightly missing their deadlines.

2. **Farthest Deadline Insertion (7E8A)**
   - **Scenario:** Effective when there are a few orders with far deadlines that are hard to fit into the schedule. Useful for balancing the load across the production lines.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Large variance in order deadlines, with some orders having much later deadlines than others.

3. **Greedy by Order Density (C702)**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable when the production and transition times are highly variable and need to be balanced against order deadlines.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High variability in production and transition times across different products and production lines.

4. **Greedy Deadline Proximity (AC6E)**
   - **Scenario:** Best when orders have tight deadlines and need to be scheduled based on urgency. Prioritizes orders that are due soon.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Orders with closely clustered deadlines.

5. **Greedy Order Selection (2882)**
   - **Scenario:** General-purpose heuristic that works well when there's no significant bias in order characteristics. Selects orders based on a specific criterion.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Balanced order characteristics without extreme values in deadlines or processing times.

6. **Least Order Remaining (9C3C)**
   - **Scenario:** Effective when the goal is to quickly reduce the backlog of unfulfilled orders, especially if many orders have short processing times.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Many small orders with short processing times.

7. **Longest Order Next (C9CB)**
   - **Scenario:** Suitable when there are a few large orders that significantly impact the schedule. Prioritizes scheduling the most time-consuming orders.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Presence of large orders with long processing times.

8. **Maximum Remaining Work Order (EC9C)**
   - **Scenario:** Works well when the objective is to tackle the most demanding orders first, ensuring that they fit into the schedule without violating deadlines.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High remaining work for some orders relative to the overall capacity of the production lines.

9. **Nearest Order Scheduling (1A5E)**
   - **Scenario:** Effective for minimizing transition times and ensuring that deadlines are met by selecting the next closest order in terms of setup time.
   - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High transition times between orders.

10. **Order Shift Between Lines (BD0C)**
    - **Scenario:** Useful when balancing the load across multiple production lines, particularly if some lines are underutilized.
    - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Uneven distribution of orders across production lines.

11. **Random (C05A)**
    - **Scenario:** Suitable for exploring diverse solutions or as a baseline for comparison. Can be useful in early stages of heuristic search or in combination with other heuristics.
    - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High variability in initial solution quality.

12. **Shortest Operation Time First (E891)**
    - **Scenario:** Effective when the objective is to quickly complete orders, especially when there are many small orders that can be completed rapidly.
    - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High number of small orders with short processing times.

13. **Shortest Order Next (25BD)**
    - **Scenario:** Similar to the above but focuses on finding the best position for the shortest order, ensuring minimal disruption to the current schedule.
    - **Quantifiable Scenario:** Presence of small orders that can be easily inserted into the schedule.

14. **2-opt Production Sequence (8E5E)**
    - **Scenario:** Best for improving an existing schedule by finding better sequences of orders on each production line. Useful when the current schedule is suboptimal.
    - **Quantifiable Scenario:** High initial fulfillment rate but with potential for improvement in order sequence efficiency.

### Quantifiable Metrics for Scenario Identification:
- **Order Deadline Variance:** Measures the spread of deadlines across orders.
- **Production and Transition Time Variability:** Measures the variation in production and transition times.
- **Order Size Distribution:** Measures the distribution of order sizes (quantities).
- **Initial Fulfillment Rate:** Percentage of orders initially fulfilled by the heuristic.
- **Load Distribution Across Lines:** Measures the balance of orders across production lines.

By understanding these scenarios and quantifiable metrics, you can select the most appropriate heuristic for a given instance of the DPOSP, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your scheduling solution.

Before this discuss, we have already 2 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_c702
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: Starting with the Greedy by Order Density heuristic to take advantage of high production rates and feasible transition times, aiming to quickly build an initial schedule with the highest density orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 14.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -11
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 5
---Round 1---
Heuristic: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 5
Explain: The Nearest Order Scheduling heuristic aims to minimize transition times and respect deadlines. Given the high transition times and the need to efficiently schedule the remaining unfulfilled orders, this heuristic should help in improving the current solution state.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 17.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -34
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 4

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e. How does nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

assistant
Given the current state data and the performance of previous heuristics, let's evaluate the situation:

- **Current Fulfillment Ratio:** 0.9 (9 out of 10 orders fulfilled)
- **Unfulfilled Orders:** 1 (Order 6)
- **Total Time Cost Per Production Line:** [7.0, 2.0, 10.0, 0.0, 12.0]
- **Feasible Orders to Fulfill:** 0
- **Solution Validity:** True

The last heuristic applied was `nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e`, which had a high delta in both total time cost and feasible orders to fulfill, indicating that it might not be the best option moving forward.

Considering the current state:
- **High Fulfillment Ratio:** Indicates that we are close to an optimal solution.
- **Only One Unfulfilled Order:** Suggests that focusing on this order might be more beneficial.
- **Total Time Cost:** Varies significantly across production lines, with some lines being underutilized (e.g., line 3 with 0.0 time cost).

### Next Steps

Given that only one order remains unfulfilled, we should aim for a heuristic that can efficiently integrate this order without significantly disrupting the current schedule. The `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` heuristic seems appropriate as it focuses on shifting orders between lines, which could help in accommodating the last unfulfilled order.

### Decision

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
running steps: 3
explanation: The `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` heuristic will attempt to shift the remaining unfulfilled order between production lines. This approach leverages the underutilized production lines to find a feasible slot for the last order, potentially balancing the load and improving overall schedule efficiency. Given the high fulfillment ratio and the presence of underutilized lines, this heuristic is likely to be effective.
