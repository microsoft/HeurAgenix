                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\ndef shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP.

By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

Below is a detailed breakdown of scenarios for each heuristic:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Applicable in scenarios where the production schedule can be optimized by swapping two non-adjacent orders to reduce transition and production times or improve order fulfillment.\n- Works best when there are inefficiencies in the current order sequence, such as high transition times or misplaced order priorities.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- High variability in **transition times** between products.\n- Production lines with **spare capacity** or underutilized schedules.\n- Orders with overlapping deadlines where swapping reduces deadline violations.\n- Metric: High variance in the `transition_time` matrix and suboptimal sequencing in `current_solution`.\n\n---\n\n### **2. `greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Suitable for prioritizing orders with tight deadlines while balancing feasibility and flexibility for future orders.\n- Effective when the number of unfulfilled orders is large, and the goal is to quickly maximize the number of fulfilled orders.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- High proportion of **orders with tight deadlines**.\n- Orders with **diverse production requirements**, i.e., some orders are much more feasible than others.\n- Metric: Large number of `unfulfilled_orders` and high variance in `order_deadline` values.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `least_order_remaining_27ca()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Effective when the focus is on fulfilling orders with the highest likelihood of completion, considering deadline proximity and production feasibility.\n- Works well in balanced production systems where all production lines are equally feasible.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- Moderate to high number of orders with **similar deadline proximities**.\n- Orders with **low variance in production feasibility** across production lines.\n- Metric: Balanced `production_rate` matrix and low variance in `order_deadline`.\n\n---\n\n### **4. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Useful when an unfulfilled order can be scheduled on another production line with better suitability, e.g., faster production speed or less transition time.\n- Best for systems with heterogeneous production lines and uneven workloads.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- High variability in **production rates** for the same product across production lines.\n- Production lines with **uneven workloads**, i.e., some lines are overloaded while others are underutilized.\n- Metric: High variance in `production_rate` and large differences in `total_time_cost_per_production_line`.\n\n---\n\n### **5. `shortest_operation_ae31()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Applicable when the goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing the shortest operations while maintaining feasibility.\n- Best for dynamic environments with tight deadlines and high variability in order sizes.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- Large number of **short-duration operations** relative to deadlines.\n- Orders with **small quantities** that can be quickly produced.\n- Metric: Low average `order_quantity` and tight `order_deadline`.\n\n---\n\n### **6. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**\n#### **Scenario:**\n- Designed for fine-tuning the production sequence within a single production line to minimize transition and production times.\n- Best when schedules are mostly feasible, but small adjustments can improve efficiency.\n\n#### **Quantifiable Best Scenarios:**\n- High **transition costs** between non-adjacent orders in the sequence.\n- Production lines with relatively **stable workloads** and feasible schedules.\n- Metric: High variance in `transition_time` within individual production line schedules and low number of `unfulfilled_orders`.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Heuristic Applicability and Metrics**\n| **Heuristic**                     | **Key Scenarios**                                                     |

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"

The `greedy_by_order_density_de77` heuristic is well-suited for prioritizing orders based on deadline tightness and feasibility. Since all orders are feasible, this heuristic can help establish a strong initial schedule by selecting orders with a balance of production feasibility and flexibility.***  "
