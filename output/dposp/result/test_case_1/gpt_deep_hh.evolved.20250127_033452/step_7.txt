I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

            assert 0 <= start_index < len(new_schedule[self.production_line_id])

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): deadline_sensitive,order_flexibility,production_efficiency,transition_time_optimization,order_processing_time,local_optimization

deadline_sensitive: These heuristics prioritize orders based on deadlines or deadline proximity, aiming to ensure orders are completed before their deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.

order_flexibility: These heuristics consider the flexibility of orders, balancing current order selection with future scheduling potential.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.

production_efficiency: These heuristics focus on minimizing production time, either by prioritizing orders that can be completed quickly or by optimizing the order sequence.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.

transition_time_optimization: These heuristics aim to minimize transition times between orders, improving overall production efficiency.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.

order_processing_time: These heuristics prioritize orders based on their processing time, either by selecting the longest or focusing on maximizing remaining work.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.

local_optimization: These heuristics perform local optimizations, such as swapping or shifting orders, to improve the current solution.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

To develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps, it's important to structure the approach into phases and identify the factors that influence heuristic selection. Here's a framework to guide the selection process:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Setup
- **Objective:** Establish a baseline understanding of the problem space and constraints.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Analysis:**
     - Examine the data on production rates, transition times, order quantities, and deadlines.
     - Identify constraints such as infeasible transitions or production capabilities.
  2. **Problem Characteristics:**
     - Determine characteristics like deadline variance, product-to-order ratio, and utilization potential.
     - Identify critical constraints like maximum transition time or line capabilities.

#### Phase 2: Construction Phase
- **Objective:** Build an initial feasible solution.
- **Heuristic Categories to Consider:**
  - **Deadline Sensitive:** Prioritize orders with tight deadlines to ensure feasibility.
  - **Transition Time Optimization:** Minimize setup times to quickly fill the production lines.
  - **Order Processing Time:** Consider processing time to balance production across lines.
- **Execution Steps:**
  1. **Select Heuristic:**
     - Begin with a heuristic from the deadline-sensitive category to ensure critical orders are addressed.
     - Use transition time optimization to refine the initial schedule.
  2. **Evaluate Initial Solution:**
     - Assess the number of fulfilled orders and identify bottlenecks or delays.

#### Phase 3: Improvement Phase
- **Objective:** Enhance the initial solution by optimizing order sequences and improving efficiency.
- **Heuristic Categories to Consider:**
  - **Local Optimization:** Perform swaps or shifts to improve the schedule incrementally.
  - **Production Efficiency:** Optimize the order of operations to reduce production time.
  - **Order Flexibility:** Adjust orders based on flexibility and potential future needs.
- **Execution Steps:**
  1. **Iterative Refinement:**
     - Implement local optimization heuristics to explore small changes with significant impacts.
     - Transition to production efficiency heuristics to streamline operations.
  2. **Monitor and Adjust:**
     - Continuously monitor performance metrics such as total production time and order fulfillment rate.
     - Adjust the heuristic strategy based on observed performance, exploring different categories if necessary.

#### Phase 4: Evaluation and Iteration
- **Objective:** Assess the effectiveness of the applied heuristics and iterate based on performance.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Performance Review:**
     - Evaluate the effectiveness of each heuristic in terms of order fulfillment and efficiency.
     - Identify strengths and weaknesses in the approach.
  2. **Strategic Adjustments:**
     - Alternate between heuristic categories to explore diverse solutions.
     - Prioritize categories that show potential for significant improvements.
  3. **Continuous Improvement:**
     - Maintain an iterative approach, testing different combinations of heuristics.
     - Use insights from previous iterations to inform future heuristic selections.

### Key Considerations
- **Flexibility:** Be open to switching between categories based on evolving problem characteristics and solution performance.
- **Balance:** Ensure a mix of construction and improvement heuristics to build a robust solution.
- **Feedback Loop:** Use results from each phase to refine the strategic guide continuously.

This strategic guide serves as a flexible framework to guide heuristic selection and execution steps. It emphasizes an iterative, adaptive approach, allowing for experimentation with different heuristics to optimize performance effectively.

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: deadline_sensitive
Running Steps: 1
Explain: Given that no orders have been fulfilled yet and all orders have the same deadline, starting with a deadline-sensitive heuristic can help ensure that we prioritize fulfilling orders within the tight deadline constraints. This approach can establish a foundation for further optimization in later stages.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->5.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 45->45
Fulfilled Order Num: 0->1
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Heuristic Category: production_efficiency
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Since the deadline-sensitive heuristic has already been used to initiate the fulfillment of orders, moving to a production efficiency heuristic can help optimize the order sequence and minimize production times. This shift can improve the utilization of production lines and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders by reducing the time cost per line. Given that there are still many feasible orders to fulfill and the current fulfillment ratio is low, focusing on production efficiency can lead to a more balanced and effective schedule.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 5.0->7.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 45->44
Fulfilled Order Num: 1->2
---Round 2---
Heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2
Heuristic Category: transition_time_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Since the previous heuristic focused on production efficiency, which helped slightly increase the number of fulfilled orders, it might be beneficial to switch to a transition time optimization heuristic. This can help minimize the setup times between orders, potentially increasing the overall efficiency of the production schedule. Given the current state with many unfulfilled orders and a high unfulfilled order quantity sum, optimizing transitions can play a crucial role in improving the fulfillment ratio and reducing time costs.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 7.0->7.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 44->44
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->2
---Round 3---
Heuristic: longest_order_next_c9cb
Heuristic Category: order_processing_time
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  The current solution shows a low fulfillment ratio with only 2 out of 10 orders fulfilled and a high unfulfilled order quantity sum. Given the previous focus on transition time optimization, shifting to order processing time heuristics can help prioritize orders based on their processing durations. This approach can maximize the scheduling efficiency by targeting either the shortest or longest processing times, potentially improving the fulfillment ratio without drastically increasing total time costs.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 7.0->17.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 44->38
Fulfilled Order Num: 2->3
---Round 4---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Heuristic Category: local_optimization
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Considering the current state of the solution, with a low fulfillment ratio and several unfulfilled orders, local optimization could be beneficial to fine-tune the existing schedule. The previous heuristics have laid a foundation by fulfilling some orders and adjusting the order processing. Local optimization can help explore small adjustments, such as swapping or shifting orders, to enhance the overall efficiency and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders without drastically altering the current solution.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 17.0->14.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 38->38
Fulfilled Order Num: 3->3
---Round 5---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Heuristic Category: order_flexibility
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, where there is a low fulfillment ratio and a high number of unfulfilled orders, exploring order flexibility could provide a strategic advantage. This category allows us to balance current order selection with future scheduling potential, potentially unlocking new ways to fulfill more orders without drastically changing the existing sequence. By focusing on flexibility, we can explore different configurations that might have been overlooked, potentially increasing the fulfillment ratio and utilizing production lines more effectively.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 14.0->16.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 38->36
Fulfilled Order Num: 3->4
---Round 6---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Heuristic Category: production_efficiency
Running Steps: 1
Explain:  Given the current state, with a fulfillment ratio of 0.4 and six feasible orders still to be fulfilled, focusing on production efficiency could help optimize the scheduling of remaining orders. This category can assist in minimizing production time and enhancing the utilization of production lines, potentially increasing the number of fulfilled orders while maintaining solution validity. The objective is to improve the fulfillment ratio by efficiently scheduling the unfulfilled orders, considering their processing times and the available production rates.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 16.0->20.0
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 36->25
Fulfilled Order Num: 4->5

Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: shortest_operation_ae31(production_efficiency). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: deadline_sensitive,order_flexibility,production_efficiency,transition_time_optimization,order_processing_time,local_optimization

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:transition_time_optimization
explanation: Given the current state, with a fulfillment ratio of 0.5 and several unfulfilled orders, focusing on optimizing transition times could help improve the efficiency of the production schedule. By minimizing setup times between orders, we can potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders without significantly increasing total time costs. This approach could further enhance the utilization of production lines and improve the overall fulfillment ratio.
