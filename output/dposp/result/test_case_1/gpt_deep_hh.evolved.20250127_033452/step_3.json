                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

                "text": "We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): deadline_sensitive,order_flexibility,production_efficiency,transition_time_optimization,order_processing_time,local_optimization\n\ndeadline_sensitive: These heuristics prioritize orders based on deadlines or deadline proximity, aiming to ensure orders are completed before their deadlines.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.\ndef farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.\n\norder_flexibility: These heuristics consider the flexibility of orders, balancing current order selection with future scheduling potential.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.\ndef least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.\n\nproduction_efficiency: These heuristics focus on minimizing production time, either by prioritizing orders that can be completed quickly or by optimizing the order sequence.\ndef shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.\ndef shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.\n\ntransition_time_optimization: These heuristics aim to minimize transition times between orders, improving overall production efficiency.\ndef exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.\n\norder_processing_time: These heuristics prioritize orders based on their processing time, either by selecting the longest or focusing on maximizing remaining work.\ndef longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.\ndef maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.\n\nlocal_optimization: These heuristics perform local optimizations, such as swapping or shifting orders, to improve the current solution.\ndef _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\n\n\nWe aim to solve this problem using the following data:\nproduct_num:5\nproduction_line_num:5\norder_num:10\nproduction_rate:[[2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 5.0], [2.0, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 5.0], [5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0], [5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]]\ntransition_time:[[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, inf], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]], [[0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0, inf], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [inf, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0]], [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], [[0.0, 3.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0], [inf, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]]\norder_product:[0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2]\norder_quantity:[10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 20.0, 10.0, 20.0, 10.0, 15.0, 10.0, 10.0]\norder_deadline:[12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0]\naverage_production_rate:[2.8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6, 3.0]\nmaximum_transition_time:inf\naverage_order_quantity:12.5\ndeadline_variance:0.0\nproduct_to_order_ratio:0.5\naverage_deadline_per_product:[12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0, 12.0]\nproduction_line_utilization_potential:[inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]\n\nIn the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 1 to test its performance.\n\nPlease develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.\n"

This approach can establish a foundation for further optimization in later stages.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->5.0\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 45->45\nFulfilled Order Num: 0->1\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: shortest_operation_ae31\nHeuristic Category: production_efficiency\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the deadline-sensitive heuristic has already been used to initiate the fulfillment of orders, moving to a production efficiency heuristic can help optimize the order sequence and minimize production times. This shift can improve the utilization of production lines and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders by reducing the time cost per line. Given that there are still many feasible orders to fulfill and the current fulfillment ratio is low, focusing on production efficiency can lead to a more balanced and effective schedule.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 5.0->7.0\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 45->44\nFulfilled Order Num: 1->2\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2\nHeuristic Category: transition_time_optimization\nRunning Steps: 1\nExplain:  Since the previous heuristic focused on production efficiency, which helped slightly increase the number of fulfilled orders, it might be beneficial to switch to a transition time optimization heuristic. This can help minimize the setup times between orders, potentially increasing the overall efficiency of the production schedule. Given the current state with many unfulfilled orders and a high unfulfilled order quantity sum, optimizing transitions can play a crucial role in improving the fulfillment ratio and reducing time costs.\nTotal Time Cost For All Production Lines: 7.0->7.0\nFeasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 44->44\nFulfilled Order Num: 2->2\n\nAfter the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:\ncurrent_solution:\nproduction_line_0: 0->1\nproduction_line_1: \nproduction_line_2: \nproduction_line_3: \nproduction_line_4: \n\nfulfilled_order_num:2\nfulfilled_orders:[0, 1]\nunfulfilled_orders:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ntotal_time_cost_per_production_line:[7.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nfeasible_orders_to_fulfill:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nfulfillment_ratio:0.2\naverage_time_cost:1.4\nmax_time_cost:7.0\nunfulfilled_order_quantity_sum:105.0\nunfulfilled_order_deadline_variance:0.0\nfeasible_order_count:8\nsolution_validity:True\nNote: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.\n\nThe last heuristic category is: exchange_production_orders_eda2(transition_time_optimization).
