                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

Here's a framework to guide the selection of heuristic categories and execution steps:\n\n### Phase 1: Construction Phase\nIn this phase, the primary goal is to build an initial feasible solution quickly. This solution may not be optimal but should satisfy the basic constraints of the problem.\n\n1. **Initial Heuristic Selection**\n   - **Deadline Sensitive**: Start with a heuristic from this category, such as `greedy_by_order_density_de77`, to ensure that critical deadlines are respected from the outset.\n   - **Flexibility Maximization**: If feasible orders are limited, use `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to explore different configurations that might allow for future flexibility.\n\n2. **Execution Steps**\n   - Run the selected deadline-sensitive heuristic to prioritize orders with tight deadlines.\n   - Evaluate the initial solution for feasibility and initial fulfillment rate.\n   - If the initial solution is too rigid, apply a flexibility maximization heuristic to allow room for future adjustments.\n\n### Phase 2: Improvement Phase\nOnce an initial solution is established, the focus shifts to improving the schedule by reducing production times and transition costs, maximizing fulfilled orders, and adapting to new data.\n\n1. **Adaptive Strategy**\n   - Alternate between different heuristic categories to avoid local optima and explore diverse solution spaces.\n   - Use feedback from the solution to guide the choice of heuristics dynamically.\n\n2. **Heuristic Categories**\n   - **Order Optimization**: Use `exchange_production_orders_eda2` or `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` to optimize the sequence of orders, reducing production and transition times.\n   - **Adaptive Scheduling**: Apply `shortest_operation_ae31` to adjust schedules based on current state data and new insights from previous steps.\n\n3. **Execution Steps**\n   - Begin with an order optimization heuristic to refine the sequence of production orders.\n   - Evaluate the impact on the number of fulfilled orders and production efficiency.\n   - Apply adaptive scheduling heuristics periodically to adjust to the evolving solution state and incorporate new data.\n   - Continuously assess the performance of each heuristic using metrics like the number of fulfilled orders, total production time, and flexibility for future adjustments.\n\n### Iterative Approach\n- **Feedback Loop**: After each heuristic execution, gather insights on solution performance, including strengths and weaknesses.\n- **Switching Strategy**: If a heuristic is not providing significant improvements, switch to another category or heuristic to explore different solution pathways.\n- **Evaluation and Adjustment**: Regularly evaluate the overall progress and adjust the mix and order of heuristics as necessary to maintain momentum toward an optimal solution.\n\nThis strategic guide emphasizes a balanced, iterative approach, leveraging the strengths of different heuristic categories to construct and refine solutions for the DPOSP. The aim is to adapt dynamically to the problem's evolving nature and maximize the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms employed."
