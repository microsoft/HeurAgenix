I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

To analyze the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable and best quantified, let's break down the characteristics of the provided heuristics and map them to specific problem scenarios. We'll also identify the best metrics to quantify their performance in these scenarios.

---

### **1. `exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **High complexity in transition times:** When the problem involves costly transitions between products or when different orders have varying transition times across production lines.
- **Optimization of local sequences:** Useful when the current solution is valid but has room for improvement in terms of production and transition time efficiency.
- **Large number of orders and production lines:** As this heuristic performs swaps, it is particularly effective in fine-tuning large solutions.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Reduction in total transition time** after the swaps.
- **Increase in the number of fulfilled orders** after applying the heuristic.
- **Improvement in schedule feasibility metrics**, such as reducing deadline violations.

---

### **2. `greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Limited production capacity:** When machines or lines cannot handle all orders, and prioritization is key to maximizing fulfilled orders.
- **Tight deadlines:** Orders with stricter deadlines need to be scheduled earlier.
- **High variability in order characteristics:** When there is significant variation in order quantities, deadlines, and production feasibility.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Weighted priority score** based on order density and deadlines.
- **Number of high-priority orders fulfilled.**
- **Reduction in unfulfilled orders**, especially those with tight deadlines.

---

### **3. `least_order_remaining_27ca()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Backlog of orders:** When there are many unfulfilled orders, and prioritization can focus on maximizing throughput.
- **Focus on late orders:** Orders that are close to or already nearing deadlines are given priority.
- **High-order count but limited flexibility:** This heuristic is effective in scenarios where production lines are near capacity and require small adjustments.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Increase in the number of fulfilled orders.**
- **Reduction in orders with imminent deadlines** that remain unfulfilled.
- **Improvement in overall solution feasibility** by fulfilling orders that were previously deemed infeasible.

---

### **4. `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Imbalanced production lines:** When some production lines are overloaded while others are underutilized.
- **Infeasible orders on specific lines:** Orders that cannot be produced on one line due to machine limitations but could be moved to another line.
- **Dynamic reallocation requirement:** Useful in dynamic environments where order priorities or machine capabilities change frequently.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Reduction in imbalance between production lines**, measured as the standard deviation of total production time across lines.
- **Increase in the number of fulfilled orders** by reallocating infeasible orders.
- **Reduction in unutilized production capacity** across production lines.

---

### **5. `shortest_operation_ae31()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **High variability in order production times:** When orders have drastically different production times, this heuristic ensures that shorter operations are prioritized.
- **Tight deadlines with flexible insertion points:** Useful when the schedule has gaps that can be filled with short operations without delaying existing orders.
- **Dynamic environments:** Works well in scenarios where the schedule needs continuous adjustments to accommodate new orders or changing deadlines.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Increase in the number of fulfilled orders**, particularly for short-duration orders.
- **Reduction in gaps or idle times** within production schedules.
- **Improvement in overall schedule efficiency**, measured as the ratio of fulfilled orders to total orders.

---

### **6. `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**
#### **Scenario:**
- **Suboptimal order sequences:** When the current production schedule is feasible but inefficient due to poor sequencing of orders.
- **Focus on local optimization:** Effective for fine-tuning within a single production line or across small subsets of orders.
- **High transition costs:** Particularly useful when transition times significantly impact overall efficiency.

#### **Best Quantified By:**
- **Reduction in total production and transition time.**
- **Increase in the number of fulfilled orders** after reordering.
- **Improvement in sequence efficiency**, measured by a decrease in the makespan (total time required to complete all scheduled orders).

---

| `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c`  | Imbalanced production lines, infeasible orders   | Reduction in line imbalance, increase in fulfilled orders, reduction in unutilized capacity            |
| `shortest_operation_ae31`         | High variability in production times, tight gaps | Increase in fulfilled orders, reduction in idle time, improved schedule efficiency                     |
| `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e`  | Suboptimal sequences, high transition costs      | Reduction in production/transition time, increase in fulfilled orders, improvement in sequence efficiency |

---

### **General Observations:**
1. **Dynamic Environments:** Heuristics like `shortest_operation_ae31` and `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` are more adaptable to dynamic problems where schedules need frequent adjustments.
2. **Static Optimization:** Heuristics like `exchange_production_orders_eda2` and `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` are better suited for refining static schedules.
3. **Prioritization-Based:** Heuristics like `greedy_by_order_density_de77` and `least_order_remaining_27ca` focus on prioritizing orders and are useful in capacity-constrained environments.

This analysis provides a roadmap for selecting heuristics based on the specific characteristics of the DPOSP instance being solved.

Before this discuss, we have already 7 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: Based on the current data, we have a high number of unfulfilled orders (200) and a feasible order count of 179. The fulfillment ratio is 0.0, indicating that no orders have been scheduled yet. The heuristic `greedy_by_order_density_de77` is well-suited to prioritize orders based on deadline tightness and feasibility, which is crucial at this early stage when constructing the initial solution. Running it for 20 steps will help establish a baseline solution by addressing high-priority orders first.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 20.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1657
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 20
---Round 1---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 30
Explain: Given the low fulfillment ratio (10%) and high imbalance in production line utilization, `shortest_operation_ae31` can efficiently prioritize short operations to improve the schedule incrementally. Running it for 30 steps will provide an opportunity to explore better insertion positions, dynamically balance workloads, and maximize fulfilled orders without compromising feasibility.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 45.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -1944
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 26
---Round 2---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 25
Explain: The current solution shows imbalanced utilization across production lines, with some lines (e.g., production_line_5 and production_line_8) completely idle while others (e.g., production_line_7) are more heavily utilized. Additionally, there are 120 feasible unfulfilled orders that could potentially be redistributed to underutilized lines to maximize the number of fulfilled orders while balancing workloads. Running `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` for 25 steps will help address these imbalances by reallocating orders to suitable production lines, thereby improving overall line utilization and increasing fulfilled orders.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 36
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 3---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 30
Explain: The previous application of `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` showed potential for rebalancing production line utilization by reallocating orders, though no new fulfilled orders were achieved. With two production lines (5 and 8) still idle and a high number of feasible orders remaining (123), continuing with this heuristic for another 30 steps could further explore opportunities to improve line utilization and increase the fulfillment ratio. The balanced reallocation of orders is likely to lay the groundwork for subsequent heuristics to build upon.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0
---Round 4---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 30
Explain: The current solution shows a fulfillment ratio of 0.23, indicating significant room for improvement. Additionally, the underutilization of production lines (e.g., production_line_5 and production_line_8) and the high number of feasible unfulfilled orders (123) suggest the need to focus on fulfilling smaller, more manageable orders that can fit dynamically into gaps. `shortest_operation_ae31` is well-suited to prioritize such orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. Running it for another 30 steps is likely to increase the number of fulfilled orders while maintaining schedule feasibility and optimizing line utilization.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 48.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -2132
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 24
---Round 5---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 25
Explain: The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic has shown consistent performance in prioritizing short operations and improving the fulfillment ratio in past rounds. Given the current fulfillment ratio (0.35) and the high number of feasible unfulfilled orders (91), running it for 25 more steps is expected to incrementally increase the number of fulfilled orders while maintaining feasibility and optimizing the utilization of underutilized lines (e.g., production_line_5 and production_line_8).
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 40.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -2730
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 20
---Round 6---
Heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31
Parameters: {}
Running Steps: 20
Explain: The previous application of `shortest_operation_ae31` has consistently shown strong performance in incrementally increasing the number of fulfilled orders while maintaining feasibility. With a current fulfillment ratio of 0.45 and a significant number of feasible unfulfilled orders (67), this heuristic remains a suitable choice to dynamically fit smaller orders into gaps and underutilized production lines (e.g., production_line_5 and production_line_8). Running it for 20 steps strikes a balance between exploration and computational efficiency, aiming to further improve the fulfillment ratio and optimize production line utilization.
Delta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 32.0
Delta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -3068
Delta of Fulfilled Order Num: 16

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

***Run heuristic:  
selected heuristic: shortest_operation_ae31  
running steps: 25  
hype parameter(optional):  
explanation: The `shortest_operation_ae31` heuristic has consistently demonstrated strong performance in improving the fulfillment ratio across previous rounds. With the current fulfillment ratio at 0.53 and a significant number of feasible unfulfilled orders (48), continuing with this heuristic for 25 steps is a logical choice. Its focus on prioritizing short operations aligns well with the remaining unfulfilled orders and the underutilized production lines (e.g., production_line_5 and production_line_8). Running 25 steps balances exploration and computational efficiency, providing opportunities to further increase fulfilled orders and optimize line utilization while maintaining feasibility.
