I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you've described is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves assigning and sequencing orders on multiple production lines while considering constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. The goal is to maximize the number of completed orders, which fits the nature of combinatorial optimization where the objective is to find the best arrangement or selection from a finite set of possibilities.

Heuristics are suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems like DPOSP, especially when the problem size is large or when exact methods are computationally expensive. Your framework, which includes a Solution and Operator structure, supports the application of heuristic algorithms effectively by providing mechanisms to generate and modify potential solutions. The use of various operators to manipulate the solution space allows heuristic algorithms to explore different configurations and iteratively improve the solution quality.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.

Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.

The heuristics you've implemented for the Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) are designed to address different aspects and challenges of the problem. Here's an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable, along with quantifiable aspects that can define these scenarios:

1. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:
   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful in situations where there are many orders with varying deadlines and a need to maximize the number of completed orders. It prioritizes orders based on a weighted score that considers deadline proximity, which is crucial when deadlines are tight.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: High number of orders with close deadlines and varying production feasibility across lines.

2. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the current schedule has potential inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequences. It's beneficial in scenarios where there's enough flexibility in the schedule to allow swaps without violating deadlines.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Presence of non-adjacent orders that, when swapped, can improve production efficiency. Metrics could include the number of possible swaps that reduce total production and transition times.

3. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:
   - **Scenario**: Suitable when there's a need to quickly generate a feasible schedule by prioritizing orders based on a combination of factors such as deadline tightness and production feasibility. It works well in environments where orders have similar characteristics.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Moderate to low diversity in order characteristics, allowing a greedy approach to provide good initial solutions.

4. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:
   - **Scenario**: Best used when there are inefficiencies in the sequence of orders on production lines. It systematically explores alternative sequences and is suited for scenarios with flexible production schedules.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Schedules with multiple non-adjacent order pairs that can be swapped to improve efficiency. High potential for reducing production and transition times through sequence optimization.

5. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:
   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where production times vary significantly across orders, and there's a need to optimize the schedule dynamically. It helps in maximizing fulfilled orders by optimizing positions and shifting orders.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: High variability in production times and the presence of many unfulfilled orders due to inefficient scheduling.

6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:
   - **Scenario**: Applicable when there's an imbalance in order distribution across production lines. It's effective in scenarios where some lines are underutilized while others are overburdened.
   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Uneven distribution of orders across lines, with some lines having spare capacity that can accommodate shifted orders.

In summary, each heuristic is designed to address specific inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement in the DPOSP. The choice of heuristic depends on the characteristics of the orders, production lines, and existing schedules. Quantifying these aspects allows for a more strategic application of heuristics, potentially leading to better outcomes in scheduling.

Considerations for Next Steps
- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?
- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?
- The last heuristic is: shortest_operation_ae31. How does shortest_operation_ae31 perform, and should we continue with it?
- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?

Decision Options:
We aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:
1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.
2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:
    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or
    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

As the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.

Try in this way:
run constructive heuristic  and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.
If last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.
If last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic: for  some steps.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: heuristic_name
running steps: N
hype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx
explanation: xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***

assistant
Given the current solution state and the summary of past rounds, it appears that the current fulfillment ratio is low, and there are many unfulfilled orders. The last heuristic applied was a constructive heuristic, `shortest_operation_ae31`, which aimed to add more orders to the schedule. Following the suggested approach to alternate between constructive and improvement heuristics, the next step would be to refine the solution using an improvement heuristic.

Since `shortest_operation_ae31` was last used, applying an improvement heuristic such as `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` could help optimize the current order sequences by exploring potential swaps of non-adjacent orders. This aims to improve the schedule's efficiency and potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders.

Here's the proposed plan:

***Run heuristic:
selected heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
running steps: 10
explanation: Applying the `_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e` heuristic to refine and optimize the current order sequences on the production lines. This heuristic will explore potential swaps of non-adjacent orders to improve the schedule's efficiency, considering production rates, transition times, and deadlines. Given the low fulfillment ratio, this is a suitable next step to potentially increase the number of fulfilled orders and reduce production and transition times.
