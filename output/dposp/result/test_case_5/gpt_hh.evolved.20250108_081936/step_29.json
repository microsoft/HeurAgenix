                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

Here's an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic might be most applicable, along with quantifiable aspects that can define these scenarios:\n\n1. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is useful in situations where there are many orders with varying deadlines and a need to maximize the number of completed orders. It prioritizes orders based on a weighted score that considers deadline proximity, which is crucial when deadlines are tight.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: High number of orders with close deadlines and varying production feasibility across lines.\n\n2. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when the current schedule has potential inefficiencies due to suboptimal order sequences. It's beneficial in scenarios where there's enough flexibility in the schedule to allow swaps without violating deadlines.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Presence of non-adjacent orders that, when swapped, can improve production efficiency. Metrics could include the number of possible swaps that reduce total production and transition times.\n\n3. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Suitable when there's a need to quickly generate a feasible schedule by prioritizing orders based on a combination of factors such as deadline tightness and production feasibility. It works well in environments where orders have similar characteristics.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Moderate to low diversity in order characteristics, allowing a greedy approach to provide good initial solutions.\n\n4. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when there are inefficiencies in the sequence of orders on production lines. It systematically explores alternative sequences and is suited for scenarios with flexible production schedules.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Schedules with multiple non-adjacent order pairs that can be swapped to improve efficiency. High potential for reducing production and transition times through sequence optimization.\n\n5. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Useful in environments where production times vary significantly across orders, and there's a need to optimize the schedule dynamically. It helps in maximizing fulfilled orders by optimizing positions and shifting orders.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: High variability in production times and the presence of many unfulfilled orders due to inefficient scheduling.\n\n6. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when there's an imbalance in order distribution across production lines. It's effective in scenarios where some lines are underutilized while others are overburdened.\n   - **Quantifiable Aspects**: Uneven distribution of orders across lines, with some lines having spare capacity that can accommodate shifted orders.\n\nIn summary, each heuristic is designed to address specific inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement in the DPOSP. The choice of heuristic depends on the characteristics of the orders, production lines, and existing schedules. Quantifying these aspects allows for a more strategic application of heuristics, potentially leading to better outcomes in scheduling."

Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nTry in this way:\nrun constructive heuristic  and then improve solution by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... as a loop.\nIf last heuristic is  constructive heuristic, we run improve heuristics by _2opt/exchange/shift_order/... some steps.\nIf last heuristic is improve  steps,we run  constructive heuristic: for  some steps.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
