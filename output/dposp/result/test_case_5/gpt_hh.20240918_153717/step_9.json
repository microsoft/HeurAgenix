                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

You are working on a Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) that involves scheduling multiple orders across various production lines with the objective of maximizing the number of completed orders by their respective deadlines.

The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.\ndef farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.\ndef greedy_by_order_density_c702(): This heuristic for DPOSP selects the next order to schedule based on an 'order density' metric, defined as the ratio of the order's value to the combined time taken for production and transition. For each unscheduled order, compute the order density as 1 divided by the sum of the production time on the assigned production line and the transition time from the last scheduled product. Select the order with the highest density value that can be completed before its deadline and append it to the corresponding production line schedule.\ndef greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.\ndef greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.\ndef least_order_remaining_9c3c(): Heuristic for selecting the next order to append to the production schedule based on least cumulative remaining work. The heuristic identifies the order with the shortest processing time left from the unfulfilled orders list and appends it to a production line.\ndef longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.\ndef maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.\ndef nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.\ndef order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.\ndef random_c05a(max_attempts: int = 100) -> tuple[AppendOperator, dict]:\n    \"\"\"Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP.\n    \n    This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it\n    to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it\n    maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.\n\n    Args): Random Order Selection Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic randomly selects an unfulfilled order from the list of feasible orders and attempts to append it to a randomly selected production line's schedule. The insertion is validated to ensure that it maintains a valid schedule respecting all production and transition constraints.\ndef shortest_operation_ff40(): Shortest Operation Heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic iterates over each production line and attempts to insert the shortest unfulfilled order that can be appended to the end of the production line's schedule without violating any constraints.\ndef shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.\ndef _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.\n\nBefore we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.\n"

To analyze the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, let's consider the unique features of each heuristic and the scenarios they are best suited for:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2**: Best for scenarios where local optima have been reached and slight adjustments to the schedule can lead to improvements. This heuristic is particularly useful when the solution space is large and complex, and the impact of swapping non-adjacent orders needs to be assessed.\n\n2. **farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a**: Suitable for scenarios where deadlines are spread out and it is important to ensure that orders with far deadlines are not neglected. This heuristic may work well when the system is dynamic and new orders with varying deadlines are continuously added.\n\n3. **greedy_by_order_density_c702**: Applicable in scenarios where the value of an order is significant relative to its processing and transition times. This heuristic is best when production speeds and transition times vary significantly across orders and production lines.\n\n4. **greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e**: Ideal for scenarios where meeting deadlines is critical and the production schedule needs to be built from scratch or re-evaluated to prioritize urgent orders.\n\n5. **greedy_order_selection_2882**: Suitable for scenarios that require a simple and fast solution, possibly as a starting point for other more complex heuristics. It works well when orders can be easily compared based on a single criterion.\n\n6. **least_order_remaining_9c3c**: Best when the focus is on completing orders quickly to avoid bottlenecks. This heuristic is useful when processing times vary widely and there is a need to balance the workload across production lines.\n\n7. **longest_order_next_c9cb**: Appropriate for situations where long orders could potentially create scheduling difficulties later on. This heuristic can be used to tackle such orders early in the scheduling process.\n\n8. **maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c**: Useful in scenarios where the goal is to maximize resource utilization by tackling the most substantial workloads first. This heuristic might work well when the system is underutilized.\n\n9. **nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e**: Suitable for scenarios where setup times and deadlines are critical factors. This heuristic works well when the focus is on continuity in the production process and minimizing transition times.\n\n10. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c**: Best for systems with multiple production lines where balancing the load and exploring flexibility in production capabilities can lead to improved outcomes.\n\n11. **random_c05a**: Applicable when exploring the solution space randomly is beneficial, possibly in the early stages of the search or when other heuristics have plateaued. It is also useful when there is no clear strategy for order selection.\n\n12. **shortest_operation_time_first_e891**: Ideal for scenarios where quick wins are important to maintain a steady flow in the production schedule. This heuristic is useful when processing times are a major factor in order completion.\n\n13. **shortest_order_next_25bd**: Suitable when short orders can be quickly completed to free up production capacity. This heuristic is best when processing times are significantly different and the goal is to minimize the time to complete orders.\n\n14. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e**: Best for scenarios where improving the sequence of orders can lead to more efficient use of resources and time. This heuristic is useful when there are many orders and complex interactions between production times and transition times.\n\nIn quantifying these scenarios, you should consider metrics such as variance in order deadlines, distribution of processing times, production line utilization rates, and frequency of setup changes or transition times. Additionally, the urgency of orders and the dynamic nature of the system (i.e., the rate at which new orders are introduced) can influence which heuristic is most applicable. Each heuristic may perform differently under varying conditions, so it's important to test them under representative scenarios to understand their effectiveness and applicability."

We'll run it for 50 steps to construct an initial solution that seeks to maximize the number of orders fulfilled without violating deadlines, considering the high deadline variance in the order data.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 125.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -2734\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 50\n---Round 1---\nHeuristic: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 30\nExplain: This heuristic is chosen to build upon the current solution by strategically adding orders that minimize transition times while considering deadlines. With the current variance in deadlines and a feasible order count of 66, there's potential to increase fulfilled orders without significantly disrupting the current schedule. We will run it for 30 steps to make a substantial impact while retaining the flexibility to adjust our strategy after assessing the results.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 87.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -3288\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 30\n---Round 2---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: This heuristic will allow us to optimize the current sequence of orders on each production line by exploring swaps that could lead to a reduction in total production and transition time. Given that we have a mix of fulfilled and unfulfilled orders across the production lines, applying this heuristic for a moderate number of steps will enable us to refine the existing sequences with minimal risk of causing disruptions to the orders already scheduled. This targeted approach can help in maximizing the number of completed orders while remaining sensitive to the tight deadlines and varied production rates.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 3---\nHeuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 25\nExplain: Given the deadline variance and the need to maximize the number of fulfilled orders, this heuristic's focus on deadline proximity could help to quickly identify orders that can be scheduled without delay, thus making effective use of the remaining production capacity and improving the fulfillment ratio.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 87.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -4183\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 25\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 15\nExplain: The Nearest Order Scheduling heuristic can help us add orders that minimize transition times and fit well with the current order sequence while respecting deadlines. By running it for a conservative number of steps (15), we aim to incrementally improve the schedule and maintain solution validity. This heuristic is chosen to balance the need to fulfill orders with various deadlines and to utilize the remaining capacity effectively. The modest number of steps will allow us to assess its impact without committing too heavily to one direction, preserving flexibility for subsequent decisions.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 60.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -3036\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 15\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 50\nExplain: Although previously this heuristic did not produce a change, we have not yet explored its full potential. By running it for a more significant number of steps, we increase the chances of finding a beneficial sequence of order swaps that could lead to the creation of new feasible orders to fulfill. The heuristic may also help to better distribute the remaining workload, which could be crucial given the unfulfilled order quantity sum and deadline variance. We need to ensure that the solution is flexible enough to accommodate new feasible orders, and this heuristic provides a method for adjusting order sequences without adding new orders, which could be key in this stage of solution refinement.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 100\nExplain: The Exchange Production Orders heuristic is selected for its ability to potentially create new feasible orders by optimizing the current schedule. Unlike _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e, which focuses on swapping adjacent orders, exchange_production_orders_eda2 allows for the swapping of non-adjacent orders, which may lead to a more significant rearrangement of the schedule and thereby uncover new feasible orders. Running it for 100 steps gives us a substantial iteration space to identify and execute beneficial exchanges, which could be critical given that we have not seen an improvement in the fulfillment ratio or feasible order count in the last few rounds.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n---Round 7---\nHeuristic: greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 50\nExplain: We are returning to the Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic as it previously added a substantial number of orders to the fulfilled list. Given that we still have unfulfilled orders and the deadline variance is significant, this heuristic could help us effectively utilize the remaining production capacity to fulfill orders close to their deadlines. We choose to run for 50 steps to have a meaningful impact while still being cautious not to overcommit in case we need to reassess our strategy.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 48.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -4623\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 18\n---Round 8---\nHeuristic: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 20\nExplain: Given that we have a number of unfulfilled orders and considering the heuristic's ability to minimize transition times while respecting deadlines, a focused run of 20 steps may reveal new feasible slots to insert these orders without disturbing the current solution significantly. The recent state changes and previous heuristic applications may have altered the solution landscape enough to make this heuristic effective again.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 0\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 0\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e. How does nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.

This might indicate that the solution space has reached a point where simple heuristics or those that don't drastically change the production schedule are no longer effective.\n\nConsidering the scenario:\n- The `fulfilled_order_num` is at 139 out of 200, which suggests that there's still room for improvement.\n- The `feasible_orders_to_fulfill` is empty, indicating that inserting orders without violating deadlines might be challenging with the current schedule.\n- The `solution_validity` is true, so the current solution is feasible.\n- The `unfulfilled_order_deadline_variance` is quite high, suggesting that there's significant variability in the deadlines that could be exploited by a heuristic that can handle such complexity.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to consider a heuristic that can potentially unlock new feasible orders by significantly altering the production schedule or focus on optimizing the current solution to make space for the remaining orders.\n\nGiven this context, I would suggest the following:\n\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: exchange_production_orders_eda2\nrunning steps: 100\nhype parameter(optional): none\nexplanation: Given that previous heuristics have not improved the solution in the last few rounds, it is time to attempt a heuristic that may introduce more significant changes to the schedule. The Exchange Production Orders heuristic can potentially reorganize the schedule in a way that creates new feasible slots for unfulfilled orders, especially considering the high deadline variance. Running it for 100 steps will provide ample opportunities to find beneficial swaps that could lead to the fulfillment of additional orders, which is our ultimate goal. This heuristic is chosen over others because it has the potential to rearrange the current schedule more dramatically than the 2-opt approach or other heuristics that have already been tried without success.\n***"
