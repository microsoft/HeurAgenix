                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.\nEach integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, production_schedule:

                "text": "Analyzing the scenarios where each heuristic is applicable requires an understanding of the specific characteristics of the DPOSP problem and the nature of each heuristic. Below is an analysis of the scenarios where each heuristic might be most beneficial, along with suggestions for quantifiable metrics to determine their applicability.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`exchange_production_orders_eda2()`**\n   - **Scenario**: \n     - This heuristic is applicable when the current production schedule has room for improvement in terms of reducing transition times or rearranging orders to meet deadlines.\n     - It is particularly useful when there are non-adjacent orders that, if swapped, could lead to a better overall schedule or increased feasibility of fulfilling more orders.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **High transition cost**: Average or total transition time between orders is high.\n     - **Low schedule efficiency**: Number of unfulfilled orders is high, or the total unutilized time on production lines is significant.\n     - **Sparse order distribution**: The orders on production lines are non-clustered or poorly sequenced.\n   - **Key Metric**: \n     - Reduction in total production and transition time after applying the heuristic.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`greedy_by_order_density_de77()`**\n   - **Scenario**:\n     - This heuristic is applicable when orders have varying levels of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential scheduling flexibility.\n     - It is most effective when prioritization based on a weighted combination of these factors can lead to better decision-making.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **Order density**: Orders have varying levels of \"density,\" defined as the ratio of quantity to the remaining time until the deadline.\n     - **High variability in deadlines**: Orders have a wide range of deadlines, from very tight to very loose.\n     - **Multiple feasible options**: There are many feasible orders to choose from at each step.\n   - **Key Metric**:\n     - Weighted prioritization score for orders and its correlation with the number of fulfilled orders.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`least_order_remaining_27ca()`**\n   - **Scenario**:\n     - This heuristic is suitable when the focus is on maximizing the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders that are close to their deadlines.\n     - It is effective in scenarios where tight deadlines significantly constrain the scheduling decisions.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **Near-deadline orders**: A large proportion of orders have deadlines close to the current time.\n     - **High deadline variance**: Orders have diverse deadlines, creating opportunities to prioritize those that are more urgent.\n     - **Feasibility issues**: There are many unfulfilled orders due to deadline constraints.\n   - **Key Metric**:\n     - Number of near-deadline orders successfully scheduled.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()`**\n   - **Scenario**:\n     - This heuristic is applicable when there are unfulfilled orders on a production line that might be fulfilled by shifting them to another line with better capabilities or lower load.\n     - It is particularly useful in scenarios with imbalanced workloads or machine-specific limitations.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **Unbalanced production lines**: Significant differences in the total time cost across production lines.\n     - **Machine-specific constraints**: Some production lines have restricted capabilities, making them bottlenecks.\n     - **Underutilized lines**: Some production lines have minimal or no scheduled orders.\n   - **Key Metric**:\n     - Reduction in the imbalance of total time cost across production lines.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **`shortest_operation_ae31()`**\n   - **Scenario**:\n     - This heuristic is effective in scenarios where orders have significant variability in production times and deadlines.\n     - It is most applicable when the goal is to dynamically adjust the schedule to maximize fulfilled orders while minimizing production and transition times.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **High variability in production times**: Orders require vastly different times for production.\n     - **Dynamic scheduling opportunities**: Frequent opportunities to insert, shift, or swap orders for better results.\n     - **High deadline constraints**: Many orders have tight deadlines, requiring efficient scheduling.\n   - **Key Metric**:\n     - Number of fulfilled orders and reduction in total production and transition time.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()`**\n   - **Scenario**:\n     - This heuristic is applicable when the sequence of orders on a production line significantly affects the overall schedule efficiency.\n     - It is particularly useful in scenarios where transition times between products are high or where better sequencing could lead to more fulfilled orders.\n   - **Quantifiable Scenarios**:\n     - **High transition cost**: Average or total transition time between products is high.\n     - **Sequence inefficiency**: The current sequence of orders leads to many unmet deadlines or high total time costs.\n     - **Opportunities for swaps**: There are multiple pairs of non-adjacent orders that, if swapped, could improve the schedule.\n   - **Key Metric**:\n     - Reduction in total time cost (production + transition) per production line after applying the heuristic.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Quantifiable Metrics\nTo determine the best heuristic for a given scenario, the following metrics can be used:\n1. **Transition cost**: Total or average transition time between orders.\n2. **Deadline tightness**: Ratio of order quantity to remaining time until the deadline.\n3. **Production line balance**: Variance in total time cost across production lines.\n4. **Production time variability**: Range or standard deviation of production times across orders.\n5. **Sequence inefficiency**: Number of unmet deadlines or high time costs due to suboptimal sequencing.\n6. **Fulfilled orders**: Total number of orders successfully scheduled and completed.\n\nBy analyzing these metrics, you can better match each heuristic to the specific characteristics of the problem instance."

Additionally, 179 feasible orders can be fulfilled at this stage. The `greedy_by_order_density_de77` heuristic is well-suited for prioritizing orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility.

The consistent lack of progress suggests that this heuristic is not suitable at the current stage. However, the current state still indicates a low fulfillment ratio (0.035) and high unfulfilled order quantity sum (3466.0), along with 172 feasible orders to fulfill. Given these conditions, switching back to the `greedy_by_order_density_de77` heuristic is recommended as it has previously demonstrated the ability to prioritize and fulfill high-density orders effectively.

How does greedy_by_order_density_de77 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2.
