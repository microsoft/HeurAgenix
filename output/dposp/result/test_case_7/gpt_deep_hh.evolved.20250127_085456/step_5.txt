I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.
In this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.
In next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.

Currently, I am working on dposp problem:
Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.

To formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:

**Maximize**
Sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)

**Subject to**
1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.
2. The start time s_ij is set to:
   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)
   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.
3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.
4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.

Where:
- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.
- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.
- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.
- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.
- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.
- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.
- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.
- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.


To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of DPOSP.
A list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of orders.
Each integer within the sublist represents an order to be fulfilled by the machine, in the sequence they are to be produced."""
    def __init__(self, production_schedule: list[list[int]]):
        self.production_schedule = production_schedule
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AppendOperator(BaseOperator):
    """Appends an order to the end of a specified production line's schedule."""
    def __init__(self, production_line_id: int, order_id: int):

            new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1] = reversed(new_schedule[self.production_line_id][start_index:end_index + 1])
        return Solution(new_schedule)

The Dynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) you've described is indeed a combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal configuration of production orders across multiple production lines, considering constraints such as production speeds, transition times, and deadlines. The use of heuristic methods to explore potential solutions and iteratively improve them is a common approach in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, especially when the solution space is large and complex, as is the case here. Your framework with various operators to modify solutions aligns well with heuristic approaches, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in searching for optimal or near-optimal solutions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have classified our heuristics into the following categories (note that some heuristics may belong to multiple categories): deadline_based,production_time_optimization,order_feasibility,sequence_optimization,order_shifting_and_relocation

deadline_based: These heuristics prioritize orders based on their deadlines, aiming to fulfill as many orders as possible before their deadlines.
def greedy_by_order_density_de77(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted combination of deadline tightness, production feasibility, and potential flexibility for future scheduling.
def least_order_remaining_27ca(): Heuristic to prioritize orders based on a weighted score incorporating deadline proximity, production feasibility, and potential to maximize fulfilled orders.
def greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e(): Greedy Deadline Proximity heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic attempts to construct a production schedule by iteratively appending orders to production lines based on their proximity to their deadline and the transition times between orders. It begins with an empty schedule for each production line and selects orders based on the closest deadline from the current time in the schedule. The heuristic also accounts for the transition time from the last scheduled order to the potential new order and production speeds, ensuring that the added order can be completed before its deadline without violating transition constraints. Orders are chosen to maximize the number of orders fulfilled, considering the remaining processing time and capacity constraints of each production line.
def farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a(): Farthest Deadline Insertion heuristic for DPOSP. This heuristic selects the unfulfilled order with the farthest deadline and attempts to insert it into a production schedule where it causes the least increase in overall production and transition times, without violating any existing deadlines. The heuristic iterates over each production line, evaluating the insertion of the farthest deadline order at various positions, considering both the production speed of the line for the product and the transition times between orders. The goal is to minimize the impact on the current schedule while ensuring that all orders are completed before their respective deadlines.

production_time_optimization: These heuristics focus on optimizing the production time by either selecting orders with the shortest or longest processing times to improve scheduling efficiency.
def shortest_operation_ae31(): Shortest Operation Heuristic with Optimization (AE31) for DPOSP. This heuristic aims to maximize the number of fulfilled orders by prioritizing orders based on deadlines, feasibility, and production times. It dynamically searches for better insertion positions, shifts orders, and periodically optimizes through swaps.
def shortest_order_next_25bd(): Shortest Order Next heuristic for DPOSP selects the unfulfilled order with the shortest processing time and inserts it into the best position in the production schedule.
def longest_order_next_c9cb(): Longest Order Next heuristic algorithm for DPOSP which selects the unfulfilled order with the longest processing time and schedules it in the most appropriate position on a production line that minimizes delays and respects deadlines.

order_feasibility: These heuristics aim to select orders based on their feasibility to be completed given the current production schedule, often considering remaining work or other feasibility criteria.
def maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c(): Heuristic that selects the order with the most remaining work that can be feasibly scheduled on any production line without violating existing order deadlines. The chosen order is then appended or inserted into the most appropriate production line's schedule, aiming to maximize the number of orders fulfilled before their respective deadlines.
def greedy_order_selection_2882(): Greedy heuristic algorithm for the DPOSP. This algorithm attempts to construct a solution by iteratively adding the most suitable order to a production line's schedule based on a specific criterion such as closest deadline or shortest processing time.

sequence_optimization: These heuristics attempt to optimize the sequence of orders on production lines, often inspired by the 2-opt approach, to improve overall efficiency and reduce transition times.
def _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e(): The 2-opt Production Sequence heuristic adapts the 2-opt approach from TSP to the context of DPOSP. It aims to improve the sequence of production orders on each production line by swapping two non-adjacent orders and re-evaluating the schedule's efficiency. By considering the production rates, transition times, and order deadlines, this heuristic explores alternative sequences that could lead to a higher number of completed orders or reduced total production and transition time. The heuristic iteratively checks all possible pairs of non-adjacent orders within a production line to determine if a more optimal order sequence can be found, taking care to maintain the feasibility of the schedule with respect to order deadlines. If a more efficient sequence is identified, the heuristic generates a ReverseSegmentOperator that applies this improved order sequence to the production line.
def exchange_production_orders_eda2(): The exchange production orders heuristic tries to improve the current production schedule by swapping two non-adjacent orders from the same or different production lines and assessing the impact on the total production and transition times. The heuristic is based on the 2-opt approach from TSP and is adapted to consider DPOSP-specific constraints such as varying production speeds, transition times, order deadlines, and production line capabilities.

order_shifting_and_relocation: These heuristics attempt to improve the schedule by shifting or relocating orders between production lines, optimizing based on machine capabilities and transition rules.
def order_shift_between_lines_bd0c(): This heuristic attempts to shift an unfulfilled order from one production line to another while adhering to machine capabilities, transition rules, and order deadlines.
def nearest_order_scheduling_1a5e(): Implements the nearest order scheduling heuristic for DPOSP. Starting from an initial order, the heuristic builds a production schedule by selecting and appending the next order that minimizes the combined criteria of setup time (transition time between orders) and proximity to the delivery deadline. The heuristic begins with either a randomly selected order or the one with the earliest deadline and iteratively adds to the schedule the order that is closest in terms of transition time from the previously scheduled order while also taking into account the urgency of order deadlines. This process continues until no further orders can be feasibly added to the schedule without violating deadline constraints.


We aim to solve this problem using the following data:

In the next conversation, I will provide detailed data, past solution steps, and the current solution status. Based on this information, you'll assess the performance of previous heuristics and select the appropriate heuristic category and execution steps. I will then choose a specific heuristic from the selected category and then run 10 to test its performance.

Please develop a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps for each phase. Not every category needs to be utilized; this guide will serve as a framework for our future decisions. Our goal is to alternate between different heuristics during the construction and improvement phases, rather than depending on a single heuristic consistently. Our approach will be iterative, enabling us to experiment with various algorithm types to assess their effectiveness. Initially, avoid relying solely on construction heuristics; test them briefly, evaluate their performance, and switch as necessary.

Developing a strategic guide for selecting heuristic categories and defining execution steps involves considering the characteristics of your problem, the available data, and the specific goals of each phase in your solution process. Here's a structured approach to guide your decision-making:

### Strategic Guide for Heuristic Selection

#### **1. Initial Setup and Analysis**
- **Goal:** Understand the problem landscape and establish baseline metrics.
- **Execution Steps:**
  - Analyze the distribution of deadlines, production rates, and order quantities.

  - **Order Feasibility:** Identify orders that can be easily fulfilled given current constraints.
- **Execution Steps:**
  - Use `greedy_deadline_proximity_ac6e` to construct a baseline schedule focusing on tight deadlines.
  - Apply `maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c` to fill gaps with feasible orders.
  - Evaluate the initial solution for feasibility and efficiency.

#### **3. Improvement Phase**
- **Goal:** Optimize the initial solution to maximize completed orders and minimize idle time.
- **Heuristic Categories:**
  - **Sequence Optimization:** Reorder existing schedules to reduce transition times and improve efficiency.
  - **Order Shifting and Relocation:** Adjust the allocation of orders across production lines to balance workloads.
  - **Production Time Optimization:** Focus on improving efficiency by adjusting order sequence or allocation based on processing times.
- **Execution Steps:**

  - Use `order_shift_between_lines_bd0c` to relocate orders and balance production line utilization.
  - Implement `shortest_operation_ae31` to identify and optimize schedules with respect to processing times.

#### **4. Evaluation and Iteration**
- **Goal:** Assess the effectiveness of applied heuristics and iterate based on performance.
- **Execution Steps:**
  - Measure the performance of each heuristic category using metrics such as the number of completed orders, total production time, and schedule feasibility.
  - Identify underperforming heuristics and replace them with alternatives from other categories.
  - Alternate between different heuristic categories in subsequent iterations to explore a wide range of solution spaces.

#### **5. Adaptation and Learning**
- **Goal:** Continuously learn from each iteration to refine heuristic selection.
- **Execution Steps:**
  - Track the impact of each heuristic on solution quality and runtime.
  - Adjust weights or parameters within heuristics based on past performance.
  - Document insights gained from each phase to inform future decisions.

### Notes:
- **Flexibility:** Be ready to shift between heuristics based on intermediate results.
- **Diversity:** Use a mix of heuristics from different categories to prevent local optima.
- **Metrics:** Continuously monitor key performance indicators to guide heuristic selection.
- **Feedback Loop:** Use results to refine and adjust heuristic strategies iteratively.

This guide will help you strategically choose and switch between heuristics, fostering an adaptive approach to solving the DPOSP problem. By maintaining a balance between different heuristic categories and iteratively refining your approach, you'll be better positioned to enhance solution quality over time.

Before this discuss, we have already 5 rounds discuss and the summary are:
---Round 0---
Heuristic: farthest_deadline_insertion_7e8a
Heuristic Category: deadline_based
Running Steps: 10
Explain:  Since the current solution has not yet fulfilled any orders, starting with a deadline-based approach can help prioritize and schedule orders that are closer to their deadlines. This initial step is crucial to ensure that the most urgent orders are considered and potentially fulfilled, setting a foundation for further optimization.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 0.0->87.5
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1868658->1848853
Fulfilled Order Num: 0->10
---Round 1---
Heuristic: maximum_remaining_work_order_ec9c
Heuristic Category: order_feasibility
Running Steps: 10
Explain:  While the deadline-based heuristic has helped in identifying and scheduling urgent orders, the current fulfillment ratio is still quite low (0.005). To enhance the existing solution, switching to order feasibility can help identify orders that can be feasibly scheduled given the current constraints and production line capabilities. This approach can increase the number of fulfilled orders by focusing on orders that are more easily accommodated in the current schedule, potentially improving the fulfillment ratio and overall efficiency.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 87.5->105.5
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1848853->1848802
Fulfilled Order Num: 10->11
---Round 2---
Heuristic: _2opt_production_sequence_8e5e
Heuristic Category: sequence_optimization
Running Steps: 10
Explain:  The current solution has a low fulfillment ratio, indicating potential inefficiencies in the order sequence or allocation. Sequence optimization can help improve the efficiency of the current schedule by reducing transition times and better organizing the order sequence within production lines. This could lead to an increase in the number of fulfilled orders and a more balanced utilization of production lines.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 105.5->105.5
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1848802->1848802
Fulfilled Order Num: 11->11
---Round 3---
Heuristic: order_shift_between_lines_bd0c
Heuristic Category: order_shifting_and_relocation
Running Steps: 10
Explain:  The current solution has shown limited improvement in fulfilling orders, with the fulfillment ratio remaining low. While sequence optimization has maintained solution validity, it hasn't significantly increased the number of fulfilled orders. Switching to the order_shifting_and_relocation category could potentially enhance the current solution by redistributing orders more effectively across production lines. This could help achieve a better balance in production line utilization, enabling more orders to be fulfilled within their deadlines. By considering the machine capabilities and transition rules, this approach can explore alternative allocations that might unlock previously unfeasible orders.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 105.5->60.5
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1848802->1848692
Fulfilled Order Num: 11->11
---Round 4---
Heuristic: least_order_remaining_27ca
Heuristic Category: deadline_based
Running Steps: 10
Explain:  The current solution has a low fulfillment ratio, and the recent attempts to improve it through order shifting and sequence optimization have not significantly increased the number of fulfilled orders. Given the unfulfilled order quantity and the unfulfilled order deadline variance, returning to a deadline-based heuristic could help prioritize and fulfill orders that are still feasible within their deadlines. This approach might unlock opportunities to fulfill orders that have tight deadlines, which were previously overlooked in the current solution configuration.
Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 60.5->75.06666666666666
Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: 1848692->1839368
Fulfilled Order Num: 11->21

The last heuristic category is: least_order_remaining_27ca(deadline_based). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: deadline_based,production_time_optimization,order_feasibility,sequence_optimization,order_shifting_and_relocation

***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:production_time_optimization
explanation: The current solution has shown some improvement in the number of fulfilled orders, but the fulfillment ratio remains very low at 0.0105. The recent use of a deadline-based heuristic has slightly increased the number of fulfilled orders, but there is still a significant number of unfulfilled orders with high variance in deadlines. Shifting to production time optimization could potentially reduce the overall time cost by identifying and scheduling orders with shorter processing times, thereby creating room for additional orders to be fulfilled. This approach can help maximize the number of orders completed within their deadlines and improve the overall efficiency of the production schedule.
