                "text": "I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.\nIn this conversation, I will introduce the problem and then framework we have built now, you just remember this.\nIn next conversation, I will describe the challenges I'm encountering and explore how we can collaborate to resolve them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on dposp problem:\nDynamic Production Order Scheduling Problem (DPOSP) involves multiple machines, each capable of producing various products. The production speed for different products varies across machines, and some transitions between products are not allowed. Each order specifies the required product, quantity, and deadline, and an order is considered completed only if all requirements are met by the deadline. Orders completed after the deadline are invalid. Each production action corresponds to an order, and the plan for each production line can be represented as a list, where each item denotes an order. The start time of each production is calculated based on the sum of the previous production and transition times, ensuring that each production is completed before the deadline. Our objective is to maximize the number of completed orders, with each order having the same priority, regardless of the quantity required.\n\nTo formally describe DPOSP, we build the following optimization model. Let X_ij represent the j-th production action on the i-th production line, whereX_ij=k indicates that the j-th action on the i-th production line is producing order k, and X_ij=0 if there is no production action. The problem includes the following components:\n\n**Maximize**\nSum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij != 0)\n\n**Subject to**\n1. For each order k, sum over all production lines (i) and production actions (j) of the indicator function I(X_ij = k) <= 1.\n2. The start time s_ij is set to:\n   - 0 if j = 1 (the first action on the production line starts at time 0)\n   - The end time of the previous action (e_i,j-1) plus the transition time between the products of the previous action (P_k_j-1) and the current action (P_k_j) if j > 1.\n3. The end time e_ij is calculated as the start time s_ij plus the quantity of order k divided by the production speed of the production line i for product P_k, if X_ij = k.\n4. The end time e_ij must be less than or equal to the deadline D_k for the order k, if X_ij = k.\n\nWhere:\n- X_ij (Decision Variable) represents the j-th production action on the i-th production line, with X_ij = k indicating production of order k and X_ij = 0 indicating no action; X_ij can take values in the set {0, 1, ..., k}.\n- v_ip (Input Variable) is the production speed of production line i for product p. If v_ip = 0, the product cannot be produced on line i.\n- t_i,p,p' (Input Variable) is the transition time for production line i from product p to product p'. If t_i,p,p' is infinity, the transition is not allowed.\n- Q_k (Input Variable) is the quantity required for order k.\n- P_k (Input Variable) is the product required for order k.\n- D_k (Input Variable) is the deadline for order k.\n- s_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the start time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- e_ij (Intermediate Variable) is the end time of the j-th production action on production line i.\n- I() (Indicator Function) equals 1 if the condition is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nTo support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.\nThe Solution is designed as:\nclass Solution:\n    \"\"\"The solution of DPOSP.\nA list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a production line's planned sequence of

Here's a breakdown of scenarios where each heuristic may be most applicable:\n\n1. **exchange_production_orders_eda2()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is suitable when the current production schedule is suboptimal due to inefficient ordering of production tasks, especially when there are non-adjacent orders that can be swapped to reduce total time.\n   - **Quantification**: Applicable in scenarios with significant variation in production speeds and transition times, where swapping orders can lead to notable time savings. It is also effective when the number of feasible swaps is manageable, allowing for thorough exploration.\n\n2. **greedy_by_order_density_de77()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Best used when prioritization is crucial, particularly in environments where deadlines are tight and production lines have varying capacities. The heuristic is effective in selecting orders that maximize the use of available time and resources.\n   - **Quantification**: Useful in high-pressure scheduling environments with many orders and limited production line availability. The heuristic's effectiveness increases with the number of competing orders and the variability in deadline tightness.\n\n3. **least_order_remaining_27ca()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is beneficial when maximizing the number of fulfilled orders is a priority, especially when approaching deadlines. It prioritizes orders that are feasible given current constraints.\n   - **Quantification**: Ideal for scenarios with a large number of orders and limited production capacity, where it is crucial to select orders that can be completed without pushing deadlines.\n\n4. **order_shift_between_lines_bd0c()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Applicable when production lines have imbalanced workloads or when some lines have excess capacity that can accommodate unfulfilled orders from overloaded lines.\n   - **Quantification**: Best in scenarios where production lines have varying capabilities and there are opportunities to reallocate orders to improve overall efficiency.\n\n5. **shortest_operation_ae31()**:\n   - **Scenario**: This heuristic is effective when the goal is to maximize order fulfillment by focusing on short operations that can be quickly completed, thus freeing up resources for subsequent orders.\n   - **Quantification**: Useful in environments where quick wins are possible due to variations in order size and production times. The heuristic is particularly effective in scenarios with a mix of short and long orders.\n\n6. **_2opt_production_sequence_8e5e()**:\n   - **Scenario**: Ideal for optimizing the sequence of orders on a production line, especially when the current sequence leads to inefficient transitions or underutilization of production speeds.\n   - **Quantification**: Best applied in scenarios with complex transition time matrices and significant differences in production rates, allowing for sequence optimization that can lead to substantial improvements.\n\nEach heuristic can be most effective in specific scenarios based on the characteristics of the production environment, order constraints, and the overall goal of the scheduling process.

This heuristic has shown effectiveness in prioritizing orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility, which is crucial in the current context. Running it for 200 more steps will allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the solution space, potentially resulting in a significant increase in the number of fulfilled orders.

This will allow for maximizing the utilization of production lines and potentially fulfilling more orders, improving the overall fulfillment ratio.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 710.8666666666668\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -318282\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 300\n---Round 4---\nHeuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 300\nExplain: Given the previous rounds of improvements using the greedy_by_order_density_de77 heuristic, it has shown effectiveness in increasing the number of fulfilled orders. The current fulfillment ratio is still relatively low at 0.4, and there remains a large number of unfulfilled orders. By continuing with this heuristic for another 300 steps, we can further explore the solution space, leveraging its ability to prioritize orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility, thus improving the overall fulfillment ratio.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1347.3333333333335\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -366102\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 300\n---Round 5---\nHeuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 200\nExplain: The greedy_by_order_density_de77 heuristic has consistently shown improvements in previous rounds, increasing the fulfillment ratio with each iteration. Given the current fulfillment ratio of 0.55 and a significant number of unfulfilled orders, continuing with this heuristic for another 200 steps can further explore the solution space. This will leverage its strength in prioritizing orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility, aiming to maximize the utilization of available production lines and improve the overall fulfillment ratio.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 1151.333333333333\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -239045\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 200\n---Round 6---\nHeuristic: greedy_by_order_density_de77\nParameters: {}\nRunning Steps: 300\nExplain: The greedy_by_order_density_de77 heuristic has consistently shown effectiveness in increasing the fulfillment ratio across previous rounds. Given the current fulfillment ratio of 0.65 and the significant number of unfulfilled orders, continuing with this heuristic for another 300 steps is advisable. This will allow us to further leverage its strength in prioritizing orders based on deadline tightness and production feasibility, potentially maximizing the utilization of available production lines and improving the overall fulfillment ratio. Larger steps are chosen to explore the solution space more thoroughly and address the remaining unfulfilled orders.\nDelta of Total Time Cost For All Production Lines: 2511.0000000000014\nDelta of Feasible Orders To Fulfill Num: -335890\nDelta of Fulfilled Order Num: 168\n\nConsiderations for Next Steps\n- Is the current data sufficient for decision-making?\n- Is there a need to construct or refine the solution further?\n- The last heuristic is: greedy_by_order_density_de77. How does greedy_by_order_density_de77 perform, and should we continue with it?\n- How much steps should we run for next heuristic?\n\nDecision Options:\nWe aim to incrementally construct an optimal solution by strategically applying a set of heuristic algorithms. Each heuristic, when applied, contributes one operator to the evolving solution. Here is the refined process:\n1. I will present you with the initial data. Your role will be to evaluate this data and select the most appropriate heuristic algorithm from our pool of heuristics. This selection will be based on predefined criteria and heuristic performance measures.\n2. I will then execute the chosen heuristic for a number of steps, resulting in a partial solution. Once this stage is complete, I will provide you with the updated solution state. Your task will be to assess the progress and determine whether to:\n    - Continue with the same heuristic algorithm to further develop the current solution, or\n    - Switch to a different heuristic algorithm from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.\n\nAs the selection hyper-heuristic algorithm agent, your role is critical in orchestrating the application of these heuristics to navigate towards an improved or final solution. Please familiarize yourself with the available heuristic algorithms and the overall decision-making pipeline. Once I introduce the specific data for our problem, we will collaborate to advance towards the solution.\nSince a lot of orders are not fulfilled, try a larger steps, such as 50, or 100, or 200, or even larger.\n\nThe response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:\n1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:\n***Run heuristic:\nselected heuristic: heuristic_name\nrunning steps: N\nhype parameter(optional): a=xx;b=xx\nexplanation: xxx\n***\n2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:\n***Stop***\n"
