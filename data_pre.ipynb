    "last_prompt_str=\"\"\"## Decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Decision Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess Historical Performance: Before each decision, evaluate the previous rounds’ results (e.g., “Delta of Visited Node” and “Delta of Current Cost”) along with current state parameters such as current_solution, visited_nodes, visited_num, unvisited_nodes, unvisited_num, current_cost, last_edge_cost, average_edge_cost, etc.\n",
    "Data-Driven Selection: Use these metrics to determine the most promising heuristic for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined Constructive and Local Improvement Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructive Phase:\n",
    "Low Incremental Cost Insertion: Prefer methods like nearest_insertion_c1f0, cheapest_insertion_605f, or insertion_heuristics_050b (set to “cheapest”) to incrementally build the tour while keeping cost increases minimal.\n",
    "Enhance Diversity: Optionally incorporate randomness through heuristics such as k_nearest_neighbors_insertion_9e8b or random_successive_insertion_57b4 to avoid premature convergence.\n",
    "Local Improvement Phase:\n",
    "Concurrent Optimization: Even during the construction process, apply local improvement methods such as _2opt_89aa and _3opt_e75b to refine partial tours and eliminate high-cost edges.\n",
    "Escaping Local Optima: Use simulated_annealing_e625 periodically to allow occasional cost increases for the sake of escaping local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Evaluation and Switching Mechanism\n",
    "Real-Time Adjustment: Based on ongoing feedback from the evaluation phase, dynamically adjust the frequency of each heuristic:\n",
    "If a heuristic (e.g., farthest_insertion_b6d3) results in a high “Delta of Current Cost,” reduce its usage.\n",
    "Increase the invocation of effective local improvements when significant cost reductions are observed.\n",
    "Hybrid Global Search: When the overall search shows signs of stagnation, apply the hybrid method greedy_randomized_adaptive_search_procedure_grasp_5a6a to balance greedy construction with randomized exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Continued Local Improvement: Even after the tour is fully constructed (i.e., when unvisited_num is 0), continue to apply local improvement methods.\n",
    "Stagnation Detection: Terminate the algorithm only when, after full construction, multiple consecutive rounds of local improvement produce no further reduction in current_cost (i.e., the \"Delta of Current Cost\" remains non-negative over several iterations), indicating that no new improvements can be achieved.\n",

Its state metrics reflect low current_cost and edge costs. It offers robust performance compared to cheapest_insertion_605f and greedy_algorithm_3ca7.
