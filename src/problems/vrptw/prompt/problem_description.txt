The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is an optimization challenge where the goal is to devise the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers within specific time frames, while adhering to each vehicle's capacity limits. In this context, the time spent traveling is directly proportional to the Euclidean distance covered. If vehicle arrives before the task's ready time, vehicle will wait until task's ready time. The service start time for each task must not exceed the task's predefined due time.
