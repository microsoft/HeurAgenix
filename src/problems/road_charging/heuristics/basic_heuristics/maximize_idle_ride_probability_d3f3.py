def maximize_idle_ride_probability_d3f3(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: callable, **kwargs) -> tuple[ActionOperator, dict]:
    """ Maximize the probability of receiving ride orders during idle times.

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "fleet_size" (int): Number of EVs in the fleet.
            - "assign_prob" (list[float]): Probability of receiving a ride order at each hour.
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "ride_lead_time" (list[int]): Remaining ride time for each EV.
            - "battery_soc" (list[float]): State of charge for each EV.
        get_state_data_function (callable): The function receives the new solution as input and returns the state dictionary for the new solution. It will not modify the original solution.
        (Optional and can be omitted if no hyper parameters data) introduction for hyper parameters in kwargs if used.

    Returns:
        An ActionOperator instance that specifies actions for the EVs based on maximizing idle ride probabilities.
        An empty dictionary as there are no updates to the algorithm data.
