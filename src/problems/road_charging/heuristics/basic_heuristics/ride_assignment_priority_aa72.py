def ride_assignment_priority_aa72(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: callable, **kwargs) -> tuple[ActionOperator, dict]:
    """ Implements the Ride Assignment Priority heuristic.

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "total_chargers" (int): The total number of chargers available.
            - "order_price" (list[float]): The payment rates at each time step.
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "current_step" (int): The index of the current time step.
            - "ride_lead_time" (list[int]): Time steps remaining for each vehicle to complete its ride.
            - "battery_soc" (list[float]): The state of charge for each vehicle.
        algorithm_data (dict): No specific algorithm data is necessary for this implementation.
        get_state_data_function (callable): Not used in this heuristic.
        kwargs: Additional hyperparameters for the algorithm.
            - "payment_threshold" (float, default=10.0): The payment rate threshold to prioritize ride assignments.

    Returns:
        ActionOperator: An operator that modifies the actions based on the heuristic.
        dict: Empty dictionary as no algorithm data is updated.
