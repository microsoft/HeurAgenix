1. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return Action with all 0, not None.
2. Please do not modify the past actions since it is already happened.
3. For any fleet that on ride where `time_to_next_availability[i] >= 2`, the action `actions[i]` must be 0, meaning the vehicle cannot charge while completing a ride.       
4. The sum of actions must not exceed the total number of chargers available, i.e., `sum(actions) <= global_data["total_chargers"]`.
5. Vehicles that are fully charged (`battery_soc[i] >= 1`) should not be scheduled for charging again, so `actions[i]` must be 0 for such vehicles.
These are hard constraints and please double check when generation heuristic.
