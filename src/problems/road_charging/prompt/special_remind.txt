1. If the algorithm returns an empty operator, please return an Action with all zeros, not None.
2. Do not modify past actions, as they have already occurred.
3. At any time step, for any EV i that is on a ride (i.e., `time_to_next_availability[i][t] >= 1`), the action at that time step `actions[i][t]` must be 0, meaning the vehicle cannot charge while completing a ride.
4. The sum of actions must not exceed the maximum number of chargers available, i.e., `sum(actions) <= global_data["total_chargers"]`.

These are hard constraints, so please double-check when generating the heuristic.
