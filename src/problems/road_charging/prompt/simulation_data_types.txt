Data Types  
Data configuartions for pricing, demand, and EV battery SoC initialization.  

Price Types 
price_type = {1:"nyiso", 2:"caiso"}
- nyiso (1): All prices are positive.  
- caiso (2): Prices may be negative during noon due to solar power generation.  

Demand Types 
demand_types = {
		1: "all_days, demand_scaling = 0.95",
		2: "all_days, demand_scaling = 0.9",
		3: "all_days, demand_scaling = 0.8",
		4: "else",
	}
Determines real-time customer arrival rates based on historical records and a scaling factor.  
- all_days, demand_scaling = 0.95 (1): Average across all days, scaled so that peak customer arrivals align with 95% of the fleet size.  
- all_days, demand_scaling = 0.9 (2): Scaled so that peak customer arrivals align with 90% of the fleet size.  
- all_days, demand_scaling = 0.8 (3): Scaled so that peak customer arrivals align with 80% of the fleet size.  
- else (4): Other configurations.  

State of Charge (SoC) Types 
SoC_types = {
		1: "0.75-0.8",
		2: "0.2-0.8",
		3: "1.0",
		4: "0.2"
	}
Defines the initial battery state of EVs within specified ranges.  
- 0.75-0.8 (1): Initial SoC is randomly set within 75%-80%.  
- 0.2-0.8 (2): Initial SoC is randomly set within 20%-80%.  
- 1.0 (3): Initial SoC is set to 100%.  
- 0.2 (4): Initial SoC is set to 20%.
