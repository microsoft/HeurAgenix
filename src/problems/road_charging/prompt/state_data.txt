state_data (dict): A dictionary containing the solution state data with the following keys:

- "current_step": The index of the current time step, where (0 <= current_step < max_time_steps).
- "operational_status": A 2D array of size (fleet_size, max_time_steps + 1), where:
  - 0 represents idle,
  - 1 represents serving a trip, and
  - 2 represents charging.
- "time_to_next_availability": A 2D array of size (fleet_size, max_time_steps + 1), indicating the lead time until the fleet becomes available (after completing a trip or finishing charging).
- "battery_soc": A 2D array of size (fleet_size, max_time_steps + 1), representing the battery state of charge in percentage.
- "reward": The total reward for the entire fleet at the current time step.
- "return": The accumulated reward for the entire fleet from time step 0 to the current time step.
