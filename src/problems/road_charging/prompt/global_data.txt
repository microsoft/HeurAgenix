global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global instance data with:
    - "fleet_size" (int): Number of EVs in the fleet.
    - "max_time_steps" (int): Maximum number of time steps, e.g., 5 minutes as a time step, 24 hours corresponds to 288 time steps.
    - "total_chargers" (int): Total number of chargers.
    - "max_cap" (int): Max battery capacity in kWh.
    - "consume_rate" (list[float]): Battery consumption rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. Length is fleet_size.
    - "charging_rate" (list[float]): Battery charging rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. Length is fleet_size.
    - "assign_prob" (list[float]): Probability of receiving a ride order when the vehicle is in idle status.
    - "average_assign_prob" (float): Average of assign probability.
    - "order_price" (list[float]): Payments (in dollars) received per time step when a vehicle is on a ride. The payment is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The length of the list is max_time_steps.
    - "charging_price" (list[float]): Charging price in dollars per kilowatt-hour ($/kWh) at each time step. The price is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The length of the list is max_time_steps.
    - "peak_charging_price" (float): Max charging price.
    - "average_charging_price" (float): Average charging price,
    - "total_energy_demand" (float): Total battery capacity of all fleets. Equal to fleet_size * max_cap.
