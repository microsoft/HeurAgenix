global_data (dict): A dictionary containing global instance data with the following keys:
- "fleet_size" (int): The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the fleet.
- "max_time_steps" (int): The maximum number of time steps. For example, with a 15-minute time step, 24 hours would correspond to 96 time steps.
- "time_resolution" (int): The length of a single time step in minutes.  
- "charging_session_time" (int): The duration of a charging session, defaulting to `time_resolution`.
- "total_chargers" (int): The maximum number of available chargers.
- "max_cap" (int): The maximum battery capacity in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- "consume_rate" (list[float]): A list representing the battery consumption rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. The list has a length equal to the fleet size.
- "charging_rate" (list[float]): A list representing the battery charging rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. The list has a length equal to the fleet size.
- "min_SoC" (float): The safety battery SoC threshold. If an EV's SoC falls below this level, it will no longer be considered for order dispatch, even if available.
- "max_SoC" (float): The maximum allowable SoC during charging, defaulting to 1.0.
- "customer_arrivals" (list[int]): A list representing the number of customer arrivals at each time step. The length of the list is equal to max_time_steps.
- "order_price" (list[float]): A list representing the payment (in dollars) received per minute when a vehicle is on a ride. The payment is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The length of the list is equal to the number of time steps (max_time_steps).
- "charging_price" (list[float]): A list representing the charging price (in dollars per kilowatt-hour, $/kWh) at each time step.  The list has a length equal to the max time steps.
