global_data (dict): A dictionary containing global instance data with the following keys:

- "fleet_size" (int): The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the fleet.
- "max_time_steps" (int): The maximum number of time steps. For example, with a 15-minute time step, 24 hours would correspond to 96 time steps.
- "time_resolution" (int): The duration of one time step in minutes.
- "total_chargers" (int): The maximum number of available chargers.
- "max_cap" (int): The maximum battery capacity in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- "consume_rate" (list[float]): A list representing the battery consumption rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. The list has a length equal to the fleet size.
- "charging_rate" (list[float]): A list representing the battery charging rate (as a percentage) per time step for each vehicle in the fleet. The list has a length equal to the fleet size.
- "customer_arrivals" (list[int]): A list representing the number of customer arrivals at each time step. The length of the list is equal to max_time_steps.
- "order_price" (list[float]): A list representing the payment (in dollars) received per minute when a vehicle is on a ride. The payment is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The length of the list is equal to the number of time steps (max_time_steps).
- "charging_price" (list[float]): A list representing the charging price (in dollars per kilowatt-hour, $/kWh) at each time step. The price is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The length of the list corresponds to 30-minute intervals in a day (e.g., 24*60/30).
