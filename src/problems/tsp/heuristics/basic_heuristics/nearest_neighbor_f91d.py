def nearest_neighbor_f91d(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: callable, **kwargs) -> tuple[InsertOperator, dict]:
    """
    Implements the nearest neighbor heuristic for the TSP problem. Starting from an arbitrary city, at each step extend the tour by moving from the current city to its nearest unvisited neighbor until all cities are visited.

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "distance_matrix" (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
            - "unvisited_nodes" (list[int]): A list of integers representing the IDs of nodes that have not yet been visited.
            - "last_visited" (int): The last visited node.

    Returns:
        InsertOperator: The operator to insert the nearest unvisited node into the current solution.
        dict: Empty dictionary as no algorithm data is updated.
