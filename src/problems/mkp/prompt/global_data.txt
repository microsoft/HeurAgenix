    - "resource_num" (int): The number of resource dimensions or constraints.
    - "profits" (numpy.array): The profit value associated with each item.
    - "weights" (numpy.array): A 2D array where each row represents the resource consumption of an item across all dimensions, so the shape is (resource_num, item_num)
    - "capacities" (numpy.array): The maximum available capacity for each resource dimension.
