state_data (dict): The state data dict containing the solution state data with:
    - "current_solution" (Solution): An instance of the Solution class representing the current solution.
    - "current_profit" (float): The total profit of the items included in the current solution.
    - "current_weights" (numpy.array): The total resource consumption for each dimension in the current solution.
    - "remaining_capacity" (numpy.array): The remaining capacity for each resource dimension after considering the items included in the current solution.
    - "items_in_knapsack" (list[int]): A list of item indices that are currently included in the knapsack.
    - "selected_item_num" (int): Number of items that have been selected.
    - "items_not_in_knapsack" (list[int]): A list of item indices that are currently not included in the knapsack.
    - "unselected_item_num" (int): Number of items that have not been selected.
    - "feasible_items_to_add" (list[int]): A list of item indices that can be added to the knapsack without violating any resource constraints. 
    - "validation_solution" (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution) -> bool: function to check whether new solution is valid.
