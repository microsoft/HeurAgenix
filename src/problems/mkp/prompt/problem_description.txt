Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the total profit of selected items, each with a given profit value, subject to multiple constraints on the cumulative resource consumption of the items. The challenge lies in selecting the optimal combination of items that yields the highest profit without exceeding the available capacity for each resource dimension.
