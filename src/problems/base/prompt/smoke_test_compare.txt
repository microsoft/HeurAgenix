In fact we run the {function_name} once, and now we got the output operation from {function_name}:
{output_result}

The updated solution are
{update_smoke_solution}
with detailed data
{update_smoke_state_data}

Please compare with your expected result: {expected_result}
1. If the result is aligned with your target output, respond to me ***python_code:correct*** and we will save the code and finish this generation.
2. If the result is not aligned with your target output and you can not generate correct one, respond to me ***python_code:None*** and we will stop this generation.
3. If the result is not aligned with your target output and you can fix up this issues, please respond to me in this format:
