To verify whether the code is correct, we conducted a smoke test.
This is the test data:
{smoke_global_data}

While executing {function_name} with the given dataset, the program encountered an error and crashed. The following error message was displayed:
{error_message}

Please try to fix it.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you think this heuristic can not be implemented, respond to me ***python_code:None*** and we will stop this generation.
2. If you can fix up this issues, please respond to me in this format:

    Args:
        global_data (dict): The global data dict containing the global data. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            ...
        state_data (dict): The state dictionary containing the current state information. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description

        (Optional and can be omitted if no used) get_state_data_function (callable): The function receives the new solution as input and return the state dictionary for new solution, and it will not modify the origin solution.
        (Optional and can be omitted if no hyper parameters data) introduction for hyper parameters in kwargs if used.

    Returns:
        Description of this operator.
        Description of updated algorithm data.
