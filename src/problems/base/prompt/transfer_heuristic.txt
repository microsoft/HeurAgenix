Let's try to transfer {referenced_heuristic}.

First generate a new heuristic name for this new heuristic and also a new detailed description to guide us how to get the new heuristic description for {problem}.
Please consider the differences between {referenced_heuristic} and the new problem that may lead to different algorithms.
By the way, the last 4 digits after last '_' are identifiers and we can ignore in new_heuristic_name.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***heuristic:new_heuristic_name;description***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
