Now focus on this operator {bottleneck_operation} in step {bottleneck_operation_id}.

The state before {bottleneck_operation} is:
{state_data}
To aid your analysis, I extracted the following features from this state:
{global_data_feature}

You believe that {proposed_operation} is better with reason {reason}. So we hope to update {function_name} to output {proposed_operation} in this state.
Try to provide suggestion to update the code using mathematical analysis.

Please provide suggestion in following one or more aspects:
1. Set the hyper-parameters or update the hyper-parameters' value for better control.
2. Add more logic to this function for better control.
3. Limit the application scope of certain logic with an if-check.
4. Consider providing different output operators, such as operation type, operation subject, operation location, operation time, etc.
5. Also consider learning from other heuristics:
{all_heuristic_docs}

To make sure the suggestion is useful, please check in following aspects:
1. Is this suggestion clear and achievable? For example, choosing operation A brings greater benefits in the form of rebates is not a clear and achievable suggestion because we do not know how to measure future benefits.
2. Will the updated suggestion make the function output {proposed_operation} in this step?
3. If we run the updated function on this data from beginning to end, will the result be better than {positive_solution} ({positive_result})?
4. Is this a commonly useful update for all instances or states?

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
