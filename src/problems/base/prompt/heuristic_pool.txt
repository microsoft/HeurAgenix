Currently, I am working on tsp problem:
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest possible route that visits a given list of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city, based on the distances between each pair of cities.

We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics inb format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
{heuristic_pool_introduction}

Please make sure to use the heuristic name I provided for the invocation, for example: "simulated_annealing_e625".
Before we solve the actual problem, please try to analysis the scenarios where each algorithm is applicable, and these scenarios are best quantified.
