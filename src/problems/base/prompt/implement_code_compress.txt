Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic {heuristic_name}:
{description}

Now please implement it in python function {function_name}.


The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***python_code:
from {components_file} import *
import other_library (if necessary)
def {function_name}(global_data: dict, state_data: dict, algorithm_data: dict, get_state_data_function: callable, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
    ...
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
