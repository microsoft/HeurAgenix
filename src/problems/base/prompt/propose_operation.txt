Now focus on {bottleneck_operation_id}: {bottleneck_operation}.

Do not forget the global data for this problem:
{global_data}

The state before {bottleneck_operation} is:
{state_data}

Please consider whether there is better operations in step {bottleneck_operation_id} than {bottleneck_operation}.
To analyze the operation, we must delve into the mathematical foundations that underpin it in following aspects:
1. How can we get this operations, we need to analysis and calculate to get this operation.
2. Why this operation is superior.
3. Examine the commonality of this phenomenon and identify any specific conditions under which this operation is particularly suitable or optimal, including global data's conditions or current state's conditions.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***propose:
proposed_operation: xxxOperation(para1=xxx, para2=xxx, ...).
calculation_process: how this operation was derived.
mathematical_analysis: why it represents an improvement.
application_scope: under which circumstances it is most applicable, including global data's conditions or current state's conditions.
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you think no superior operation, simply respond with ***None***.
