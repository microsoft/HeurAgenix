To assess the performance of the evolved heuristics, I have tested both the original heuristic {basic_heuristic_name} and the evolved heuristic {last_heuristic_name}.
The following table presents a comparative analysis of these heuristics. The first {feature_num} columns represent the features of the testing data, while the remaining columns show the results.
A {compare} result indicates better performance, and the improvement ratio (in brackets, positive means to improve and negative means decline) reflects the enhancement relative to {basic_heuristic_name}.

{benchmark_result}

It is evident that in some scenarios, the new heuristic performs well, although there is still room for improvement. Based on the results, please analyze the following:
1. In which cases does the new heuristic perform well, and in which cases is it not satisfactory?
2. What factors contribute to these differences in performance?
3. Is the updated heuristic {last_heuristic_name} better than previous heuristic {previous_heuristic_name} and is the previous evolution suggestion {last_suggestion} works?
4. How can we further refine the new heuristics?

We believe that further refinement of the new heuristic is necessary.

Please analyze the results and provide one executable code adjustment suggestion (in word, not code).

We believe the idea is correct: {last_suggestion}.
While we need detailed refinement, such as:
1. This may involve changing default values or adopting dynamic values tailored to specific data.
2. This includes aspects such as operation type, subject, location, and timing.
3. Should we continue to deepen origin suggestion or weaken this suggestion.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you believe the code still need to be updated, please respond to me in this format:
***refinement: 
result analysis: xxx
code adjustment suggestion: xxx
***
2. If you think current heuristic are good enough, please respond to me in this format:
***refinement: 
result analysis: None
code adjustment suggestion: None
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
