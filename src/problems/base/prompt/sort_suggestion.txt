Now review the origin code {function_name}:
{function_code}

After analysis on between positive and negative solution, we have already got some suggestions:
{suggestions}

We hope to apply these suggestions into nearest_neighbor heuristic, while before to implement the code, we need to review and update the suggestions:
1. Some suggestions are similar or duplicated, we can merge them.
2. Some suggestions conflict and we need to modify them.
3. The application conditions of some suggestions are unreasonable, we need to correct them.
4. Some suggestions will bring too heavy calculation, we have to optimize.
5. We only need to keep the suggestions that have a greater impact and are likely to be useful.

So based on these, please refine these suggestions with clear conditions and sort them into heuristic code improve suggestion
consider to sort suggestion:
1. better selection
2. better parameters
3. insert more structure
4. learn from other heuristics

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***code_suggestion:
1. xxx
2. xxx

Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
