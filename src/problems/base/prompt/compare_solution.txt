In this instance, I have developed a heuristic function, although its performance has not reached a satisfactory level. My goal is to learn from case studies to improve and optimize this heuristic. To achieve this, I will provide the following:
1. The heuristic function code.
2. Test data for evaluation.
3. Negative solution from heuristic function.
4. Positive solution from external.

The function {function_name} is the heuristic function:
{function_code}

The global data for this problem:
{global_data}

Negative solution from {function_name}:
{negative_solution}

Positive solution from external:
{positive_solution}

Please based on the data and solution, compare the difference between these two solution and list the difference.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***solution_difference:
1. xxx
2. xxx
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
