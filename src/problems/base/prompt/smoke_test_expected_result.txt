To verify whether the code is correct, we conducted a smoke test.
This is the test data:
{smoke_global_data}

We run the following operations:
{previous_operations}

The current solution are
{smoke_solution}
with detailed data
{smoke_state_data}

Now we run {function_name} once and think about what the expected output is.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***expected_result:xxx***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
