Now, let review the global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
{global_data_feature}
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

Before this discuss, we have already {discuss_round} rounds discuss and the summary are:
{heuristic_traject}

After the previous running, the state data some heuristic values for current stage:
{state_data_feature}
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The last heuristic category is: {last_heuristic}({last_heuristic_category}). How it works?
Should me:
- Continue with the same heuristic category to further develop the current solution, or
- Switch to a different heuristic category from our pool to either enhance the existing solution or take a new approach to the problem.

We intend to choose a target heuristic category from the following options: {category_names}

The response format is very important.
1. If you believe the we should continue to build or improve solution, please respond to me in this format:
***continue_run:
select_heuristic_category:xxx({category_names})
explanation:xxx
***
2. If you think the solution can not be improved, please respond to me in this format:
***Stop***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
