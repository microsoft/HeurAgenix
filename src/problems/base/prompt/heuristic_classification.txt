We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics in format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
{heuristic_pool_introduction}

Before we solve the actual problem, we hope to select useful algorithms and classify them so that we can use different algorithms in different scenarios. 
We hope to classify algorithms and use different algorithms in different scenarios. 
Please note:
1. We only hope to sort useful and powerful heuristic, some heuristic are not powerful, such pure random heuristic;
2. One heuristic can belong to multiple classification;
3. Detailed classification is welcome.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***heuristic_classification:
classification1:heuristic_name_1,heuristic_name_2,...;reason
classification2:heuristic_name_3,heuristic_name_4,...;reason
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
