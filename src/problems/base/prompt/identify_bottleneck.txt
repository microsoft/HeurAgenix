Now, we hope to pick out the bottleneck operations in negative solution.
Please note:
1. Some operations, although they appear different, are essentially the same.
2. Some operations may lead to solutions that look different but are essentially the same.
3. Some operations may cause changes to the solution but do not affect the final cost; these are not considered bottlenecks.
4. When an operation A is performed poorly, leading to a series of subsequent operations experiencing issues, we consider the first operation A to be a bottleneck.

Please remember that these results were produced by {function_name}, and we hope to use them to identify the weaknesses of {function_name}.
Combine the solution_difference and operation difference before, try to find out the bottleneck operations ids.
The negative solution leads {negative_result} with the following trajectory:
{negative_trajectory}

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***bottleneck_operations:
OperationID; reason
OperationID; reason
....

Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** are welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
