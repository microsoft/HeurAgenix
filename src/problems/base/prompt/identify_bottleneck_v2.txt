In this instance, I have developed a heuristic function, although its performance has not reached a satisfactory level. My goal is to learn from case studies to improve and optimize this heuristic. To achieve this, I will provide the following:
1. The heuristic function code.
2. Test data for evaluation.
3. Negative solution from heuristic function.
4. Positive solution from external, which is better than negative solution.

The function {function_name} is the heuristic function:
{function_code}

The global data for this problem:
{global_data}
To aid your analysis, I extracted the following features from this data:
{global_data_feature}

Negative solution from {function_name}:
{negative_solution}
The result is {negative_result}.
The trajectory to get this solution:
{negative_trajectory}

Positive solution from external:
{positive_solution}
The result is {positive_result}.
The trajectory to get this solution:
{positive_trajectory}

Please based on the data and solution, help to pick out the bottleneck operations in negative solution, which may cause the poor performance
Please note:
1. Some operations, although they appear different, are essentially the same.
2. Some operations may lead to solutions that look different but are essentially the same.
3. Some operations may cause changes to the solution but do not affect the final cost; these are not considered bottlenecks.
4. When an operation A is performed poorly, leading to a series of subsequent operations experiencing issues, we consider the first operation A to be a bottleneck.
5. If there is only one item, there is no need to force multiple answers.
6. Try to propose a better operator than origin one and you can learn from positive solution or others.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***bottleneck_operations:
negative_operator_id; proposed_better_operator; reason
negative_operator_id; proposed_better_operator; reason
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
