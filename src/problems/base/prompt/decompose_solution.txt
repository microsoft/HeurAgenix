Then we decompose the solution.

The positive solution leads {positive_result} with the following trajectory:
{positive_trajectory}
The negative solution leads {negative_result} with the following trajectory:
{negative_trajectory}

Now we hope to analysis in operation level why negative operations leads to poor performance.

Please note: 
1. Some operations look different, but actually express the same effect.
