Then, let's focus on the features of the state data for the {problem}. 
{global_data_introduction}
{state_data_introduction}

In determining the optimal features (statistical data) to represent current state (in other word current solution) features and quality, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the solution feature.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different solution stage.
3. We need to evaluate the current status from multiple dimensions, including the current progress of the solution, the quality of the solution, the status of the remaining data, etc.

Now, please tell me which features are best serve as state data features.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
