Online Bin Packing Problem (Online BPP) is a dynamic and combinatorial optimization challenge where the objective is to efficiently assign a sequence of items of varying sizes, arriving one at a time, into a finite number of bins with fixed capacity. The problem requires making immediate, irrevocable decisions about the placement of each item as it arrives, without knowledge of future items. The goal is to minimize the total number of bins used while ensuring that the sum of item sizes in each bin does not exceed its capacity. This online variant emphasizes real-time decision-making and adaptability in resource allocation as new data becomes available sequentially.
