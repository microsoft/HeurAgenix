- "current_solution" (Solution): Current scheduling solution.
- "fulfilled_order_num" (int): Number of fulfilled orders.
- "fulfilled_orders" (list[int]): List of fulfilled orders.
- "unfulfilled_orders" (list[int]): List of unfulfilled orders.
- "total_time_cost_per_production_line" (numpy.array): 1D array of the sum of production and transition times for each production line.
- "feasible_orders_to_fulfill" (list): The feasible orders that can be fulfilled based on the current solution without delaying other planned orders.
- "validation_single_production_schedule" (callable): def validation_single_production_schedule(production_line_id: int, production_schedule: list[int]) -> bool: function to check whether the production schedule is valid.
